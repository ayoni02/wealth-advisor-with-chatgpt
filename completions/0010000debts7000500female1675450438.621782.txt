The first thing you should do is make a budget. You need to find out how much money you are bringing in every month and how much you are spending. Once you have a good understanding of your monthly cash flow, you can start working on reducing your expenses and/or increasing your income.

If you are not already doing so, you should start paying yourself first by putting some money into savings every month. This will help you build up a buffer in case of unexpected expenses and also give you a head start on meeting your financial goals.

If one of your financial goals is to reduce your debt, you should focus on paying off the debts with the highest interest rates first. This will save you money in the long run and help you get out of debt sooner.

In general, you should try to keep your expenses low and your income high. This will help you build up your savings and reach your financial goals quicker.
