Assuming this person's goal is to buy a car, they should first assess how much they can afford to spend on a car and factor that into their budget. They may need to adjust their monthly expenses in order to save up for a down payment on the car. They should also consider how much they can afford to spend on car payments each month. Once they have factored all of this into their budget, they can start saving up for their car. They may also want to consider investing in a car that will appreciate in value over time so that they can sell it for a profit in the future.
