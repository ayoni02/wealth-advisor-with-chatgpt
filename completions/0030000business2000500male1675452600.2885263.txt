Assuming that this person would like to learn how to manage their finances better, here are some key tips: 

 1. Make a budget: Track your income and expenses for a month to get an idea of where your money goes. This will help you identify areas where you can cut back or save more.

2. Cut back on unnecessary expenses: Take a close look at your spending and identify any areas where you can cut back, such as eating out, entertainment, or shopping.

3. Invest in yourself: Consider taking a financial management course or investing in some personal development books or resources.

4. Automate your finances: Set up automatic payments for your bills and transfers to your savings account. This will help you stay on top of your finances and avoid late payments or overdraft fees.

5. Create a savings plan: Determine how much you want to save each month and make it a priority to transfer that amount to your savings account. This will help you build up your savings so you can reach your financial goals.
