Assuming you would like good comprehensive financial advice for this person: 

The first step would be to figure out what the person's debt situation is. If they have a lot of high-interest debt, it would be important to focus on paying that off as soon as possible. One way to do that would be to put any extra money towards the debt with the highest interest rate. Another would be to focus on paying off the debt with the smallest balance first to get a "quick win" and boost motivation.

Once the debt is under control, the next step would be to start building up savings. An emergency fund is a good place to start, with the goal being to have enough saved to cover 3-6 months of living expenses. Once that is accomplished, other financial goals can be tackled, such as saving for a down payment on a house or investing for retirement.
