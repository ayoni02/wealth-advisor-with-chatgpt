Assuming this person is living paycheck to paycheck, the first thing I would recommend is creating a budget. This will help to get a better understanding of where their money is going and where they can cut back in order to save. I would also recommend looking into saving strategies, such as setting aside a certain amount of money each paycheck into a savings account. This will help to build up a financial cushion in case of unexpected expenses. Finally, I would recommend creating a plan for their financial goals, such as how much they need to save in order to afford their desired vacation.
