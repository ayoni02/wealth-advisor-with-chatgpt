There are a few things to consider when trying to save for a home. One is to make sure that you have an emergency fund saved up in case of any unexpected expenses. Another is to try to reduce your monthly expenses as much as possible. One way to do this is to see if you can get a lower interest rate on your rent. Another idea is to try to invest in something that will give you a higher return over time.
