Assuming this person is single:

1. Begin by contributing the maximum amount to a 401k account. In 2020, the 401k contribution limit is $19,500. This will allow you to reduce your taxable income and also begin saving for retirement.

2. Make sure you are taking advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is free money that can help you reach your financial goals.

3. Begin saving for retirement in an IRA account. You can contribute up to $6,000 per year in a Roth IRA.

4. Make sure you have an emergency fund that can cover 3-6 months of living expenses. This will help you cover unexpected costs in the event that you lose your job or have a major unexpected expense.

5. Try to reduce your monthly expenses by cutting back on non-essential items. This will free up more money that you can contribute to your retirement savings.

6. Consider investing in a index fund or mutual fund. This can help you earn additional return on your investment that can help you reach your financial goals.
