The most obvious advice would be to invest some of that salary into a business. However, given the other financial obligations it might be difficult to save up enough money to do so. One option could be to look into business loans or finding a partner with complementary financial needs. Another option would be to cut back on the monthly expenses, perhaps by downsizing to a smaller apartment, in order to save up for a business.

Another important piece of advice would be to start investing for the future. This could be done by setting up a retirement account and/or investing in a diversified mix of stocks and bonds. Doing this will help to ensure financial security later on in life.

Finally, it is always important to be mindful of one's financial situation and to make sure that all monthly bills and expenses are paid on time. This will help to avoid any late fees or penalties, and will also help to improve one's credit score.
