Assuming this person is looking for financial advice in regards to their goals, the best advice would be to start saving as soon as possible. An emergency fund should be a priority for everyone, but is especially important for those who do not have a lot of financial cushion. This person should try to save at least 3-6 months worth of living expenses so that they can cover themselves in case of job loss or other unforeseen circumstances.

In addition to saving, this person should also invest in themselves by continuing their education or learning new skills that can help them get a higher paying job. Another way to increase their income is to look for opportunities to earn additional income through side hustles or freelance work.

Last but not least, this person should create a budget and stick to it. Tracking their monthly expenses will help them become more aware of their spending patterns and help them make more informed choices about their finances.
