There are a few things to consider when giving financial advice to someone in this situation. One is to make sure that their monthly expenses are covered by their income, so that they are not accruing debt. Another is to consider their financial goals and how best to save for them.

For example, if the person's goal is to buy a home, they may want to consider saving for a down payment. They may also want to invest in a retirement account, such as a 401(k) or IRA, to help secure their financial future.

It's also important to give advice that is tailored to the person's individual situation. For instance, if the person is single and has no children, their financial goals and best course of action may be different than if they were married with children.

 Ultimately, the best financial advice is to create a budget and stick to it. This will help the person to stay on track with their expenses and saving goals.
