Assuming this person is single with no dependents, a good comprehensive financial plan would include the following advice:

1. Save: Invest 20% of your salary into savings each month. This will help you build up a nest egg for retirement, as well as provide a buffer in case of unexpected expenses.

2. Invest: Invest your savings into a mix of low- and high-risk investments. This will help you grow your wealth over time while minimizing the risk of losing money.

3. Live below your means: Make sure your monthly expenses are below your monthly income. This will help you save more money each month and reach your financial goals more quickly.

4. Have a plan: Set financial goals and create a budget to help you track your progress. This will help you stay on track and make progress towards your goals.
