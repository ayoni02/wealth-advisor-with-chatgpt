Assuming you would like advice for the person with the above financial situation: 

Some advice that could be given is to invest in a growth stock mutual fund, which has the potential to generate returns that can outpace inflation. Another suggestion is to start contributing to a retirement savings plan, such as a 401(k) or Individual Retirement Account (IRA). This will allow the person to start saving for their future and taking advantage of any employer matching contributions that may be offered. Additionally, it may be beneficial to create a budget to help track expenses and ensure that monthly expenses do not exceed income. Finally, it is important to have financial goals in mind, such as saving for a down payment on a house or funding a child's education, and to develop a plan to reach those goals.
