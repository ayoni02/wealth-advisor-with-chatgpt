Here are some things to keep in mind:

1. Make a budget: You need to know where your money is going each month in order to make informed financial decisions. Track your income and expenses so that you can identify areas where you can cut back.

2. Pay off debts: High interest debt is a major burden on your finances. Work to pay off debts as quickly as possible so that you can free up more money each month.

3. Invest: Begin investing for your future. Investing early will help you reach your financial goals more quickly.

4. Save: Make sure to set aside money each month for savings. An emergency fund is a crucial part of financial security.

5. Live within your means: Avoid overspending and only purchase what you can afford. This will help you stay on track with your financial goals.
