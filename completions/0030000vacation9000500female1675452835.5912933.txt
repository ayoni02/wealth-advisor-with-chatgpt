Firstly, the person should make a budget in order to see what their monthly income and expenses are. They should make sure to include all of their debts and other financial obligations in this budget. Once they have done this, they should work on creating a savings plan. Even if their salary is low, they should try to put away some money each month into a savings account. They can also look into ways to make additional income, such as through renting out a room in their house or getting a part-time job. Once they have established a savings plan, they can start working towards their financial goal of taking a vacation. They should research different vacation destinations and figure out how much money they will need to save in order to take the trip.
