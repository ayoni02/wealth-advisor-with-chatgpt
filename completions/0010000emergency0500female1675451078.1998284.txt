Assuming this person would like advice on how to best save and grow her money, we would recommend the following:

1. Invest in a diversified mix of assets, including stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents.

2. Consider saving at least three to six months’ worth of living expenses in an emergency fund.

3. Invest in yourself by contributing regularly to a retirement account, such as a 401(k) or IRA.

4. If your employer offers a matching contribution, be sure to take advantage of it.

5. Consider saving for other goals, such as a down payment on a home or a child’s education.

6. Work with a financial advisor to develop a comprehensive financial plan that includes saving, investing, and protection from risks.
