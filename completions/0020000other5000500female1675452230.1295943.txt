Assuming this person would like to save money: 

1. One of the best ways to save money is to set up a budget and stick to it. Determine how much you need to spend each month on essentials, and then make sure you do not spend more than that. 

2. Another great way to save money is to cut back on unnecessary expenses. If you find that you are spending a lot of money on non-essentials, see if there are ways to reduce those expenses. 

3. Investing is also a great way to save money. Consider investing in a 401k or other retirement account. This will allow you to save money for the future while also getting tax breaks. 

4. Finally, make sure you have a savings account that you can put money into each month. This will help you create a cushion in case of unexpected expenses or financial hardships.
