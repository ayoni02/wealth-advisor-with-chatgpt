Assuming this person is living in the US: 

First, this person should try to save up for a down payment on a house. A good rule of thumb is to aim for a down payment that is at least 20% of the purchase price of the house. In order to do this, the person should try to cut back on their monthly expenses as much as possible and put the extra money into savings. It may also be a good idea to invest some of their money in order to try to grow their savings.

Once the person has saved up enough for a down payment, they should start looking for a house that is within their budget. It is important to remember that the monthly mortgage payments will be one of the biggest expenses, so the person should make sure they can afford the payments before making an offer on a house.

Once the person has bought a house, they should focus on paying off the mortgage as quickly as possible. One way to do this is to make extra payments each month or make bi-weekly mortgage payments instead of monthly payments. Another way to pay off the mortgage quicker is to refinance the loan at a lower interest rate.

After the mortgage is paid off, the person should focus on saving up for retirement. They should start by contributing to a 401k or IRA account. If their employer offers a 401k match, they should make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. Once they have a good amount saved up in their retirement account, they can start investing in other areas such as stocks, mutual funds, and real estate.
