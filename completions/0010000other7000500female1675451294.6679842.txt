There are a few things that this person can do in order to improve their financial situation. One thing they could do is try to negotiate their salary with their employer. If they are able to get a raise, that will give them more money to work with each month. Another thing they could do is look for ways to reduce their monthly expenses. Any money that they are able to save each month can be put into savings or used to pay down debt.

Another financial goal that this person may want to consider is investing. Even if the returns from investments are low, over time they can add up. This is especially true if the person is able to invest in something with the potential for growth, such as a stock or mutual fund.

Ultimately, the best financial advice for this person is to create a budget and stick to it. This will help them to track their spending and make sure that their monthly expenses are in line with their income. If they can do this, they will be on the right track to achieving their financial goals.
