Assuming this person is living in the United States: 

The most important thing this person can do is to start saving as much money as possible. Even though his salary is not very high, he should try to put away at least $500 into savings each month. He should also look into investing in some sort of low-risk/low-return investment, such as a money market account or a CD. This will help him to grow his savings over time.

Another important thing this person should do is to try to reduce his monthly expenses. One way to do this is to see if he can get a lower rate on his rent. He should also be mindful of his other expenses, such as his monthly phone bill and groceries. By cutting back on his spending, he will be able to save even more money each month.

Lastly, this person should have some financial goals in mind. What does he want to achieve with his money? Does he want to buy a house, save for retirement, or something else? Once he has some specific goals in mind, he can start working towards them. For example, if he wants to buy a house, he should start saving up for a down payment. If he wants to save for retirement, he should start contributing to a 401k or IRA.

No matter what his financial goals are, this person should start working on them as soon as possible. The sooner he starts saving and investing, the better off he will be in the long run.
