Ideally, the person in this situation should be saving around 10% of their salary each month, which would amount to $300. This could be deposited into a savings account, used to pay down debt, or invested in a longer-term goal such as education. The individual in this situation should also be sure to have an emergency fund that can cover at least 3-6 months of living expenses, in case of a job loss or unexpected expenses.
