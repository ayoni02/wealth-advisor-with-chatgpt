The first step is to get a clear understanding of your financial situation. This includes knowing your income, your debts, your monthly expenses, and your financial goals. Once you have a clear understanding of your situation, you can begin to make a plan.

For this person, the first priority should be to build up her savings. A good goal to set is to have three to six months of living expenses saved in case of an emergency. This may take some time to achieve, but it is important to have a cushion of savings to fall back on.

In addition to saving, this person should also focus on paying down her debt. Debt can be a burden and can make it difficult to reach financial goals. Try to make extra payments on debts each month to get them paid off as quickly as possible.

Finally, this person should focus on her financial goals. In this case, education is the goal. Begin by saving for specific education expenses, such as tuition and textbooks. Look into financial aid and scholarships to help pay for school. Creating a budget for education expenses can help you reach your goals.
