Assuming this person is living paycheck to paycheck, the first step would be to establish a budget and figure out where their money is going each month. Once they have a clear picture of their spending, they can begin to work on building up their savings so that they can eventually reach their financial goal of retirement.

One key element of this budget should be putting aside money each month into an emergency fund, so that unexpected expenses can be covered without derailing their whole financial plan. Another important aspect of their budget should be contributing to a retirement account, such as a 401(k) or an IRA. This will help them take advantage of compound interest and grow their retirement savings over time.

Given their relatively low salary, this person may need to be especially mindful of their spending in order to make progress on their financial goals. They may need to make some sacrifices in the short-term in order to secure their financial future.
