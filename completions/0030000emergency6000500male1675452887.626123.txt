Assuming this person is living in the United States, some good financial advice for him would be to start saving for an emergency fund as soon as possible. This fund should ideally be equal to 3-6 months of living expenses, so in this case, the goal should be to save at least $18,000. Additionally, this person should try to reduce his monthly expenses by cutting back on unnecessary spending and/or increasing his income. He could also consider investing his money in order to earn better returns than what he is currently getting.
