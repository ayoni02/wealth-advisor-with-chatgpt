The first step is to build up an emergency fund so that you have a cushion to fall back on in case of unexpected expenses. You should aim to save up at least 3-6 months' worth of living expenses. Once you have done that, you can start thinking about investing your money.

There are a few different ways to invest your money, but one of the safest and most Conservative investments is to put your money into a high yield savings account or a short-term bond fund. These types of investments will give you a relatively low but steady return on your investment, which can be helpful if you are trying to reach specific financial goals.

If you are looking to make more of a return on your investment, you can consider investing in stocks or mutual funds. These types of investments can give you the potential to make a higher return, but they also come with more risk. It is important to do your research and make sure you are comfortable with the level of risk you are taking on before investing in anything.

Overall, it is important to have a solid financial plan in place. If you are not sure where to start, you may want to consider meeting with a financial advisor to help you create a plan that is tailored to your specific needs and goals.
