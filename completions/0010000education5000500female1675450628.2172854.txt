Assuming this person is single:

The first thing you should do is see if you can negotiate a higher salary. If you are earning $10,000 per year, you are likely not making enough to cover your basic living expenses, let alone save for your future goals. Use salary negotiation strategies to try to get a raise from your employer.

Next, you should focus on building up your savings. Even if you are only able to save a small amount each month, it is important to start somewhere. You can open up a savings account and set up a direct deposit from your paycheck so that you are automatically saving money each month.

Once you have built up some savings, you should start investing your money. Investing is a great way to grow your money over time, and there are many different ways to invest depending on your goals. If you are looking to save for education, you may want to consider investing in a 529 plan.

Finally, make sure you are staying on top of your monthly expenses. Track where you are spending your money and see if there are any areas where you can cut back. For example, if you are eating out regularly, you may want to cook at home more to save money.

By following these tips, you can start to get your finances in order and reach your financial goals.
