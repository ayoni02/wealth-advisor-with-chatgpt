Here are a few pieces of advice for the person with the given financial situation:

1. Review your monthly expenses and try to identify areas where you can cut back. For example, if you are eating out frequently, cooking at home more often can save you money.

2. Make a budget and stick to it. Track your income and expenses so that you know where your money is going each month.

3. Try to increase your income by looking for a higher paying job or earning additional income through side hustles.

4. Save as much money as possible. Even if you can only save a small amount each month, it will add up over time. Try to have at least 3-6 months of living expenses saved so that you have a cushion in case of tough times.

5. Invest your money wisely. Research different investment options and find one that best suits your goals and risk tolerance.

6. Plan for retirement. Start contributing to a retirement account as soon as possible. The sooner you start saving, the more time your money has to grow.
