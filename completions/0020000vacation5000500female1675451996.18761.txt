Assuming this person wants to focus on a short-term financial goal, my advice would be as follows: 

1. Review your monthly expenses and see where you can cut back in order to boost your savings. For example, eating out less often or cutting back on unnecessary subscriptions/memberships.

2. Make a budget and track your progress to ensure you are sticking to it.

3. Open a savings account and set up automatic transfers from your checking account each month. This will help you make headway on your goal while also getting into the habit of saving regularly.

4. Shop around for the best deals on travel expenses, such as flights, accommodations, and attractions. Use sites like Expedia or Travelocity to compare prices and look for discounts.

5. Start thinking about longer-term financial goals, such as retirement. Even if you are not ready to start saving for retirement just yet, it is never too early to start thinking about it and making a plan.
