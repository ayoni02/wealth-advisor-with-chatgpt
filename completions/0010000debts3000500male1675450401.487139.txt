The first step is to make a budget and track all your spending for a month to get an idea of where your money is going. Try to find areas where you can cut back, even by a little bit, to free up some extra cash.

Next, focus on paying off your debts as quickly as possible. Make a list of all your debts from smallest to largest, and then make a plan to pay them off one by one. You may need to make some sacrifices in your spending in order to allocate more money towards debt repayment, but it will be worth it in the long run to get out of debt as soon as possible.

Finally, start saving for your future goals. Even if you can only save a small amount each month, it will add up over time and give you a cushion to fall back on in case of an emergency. When you have reached your debt repayment goals, you can start putting more money into savings.
