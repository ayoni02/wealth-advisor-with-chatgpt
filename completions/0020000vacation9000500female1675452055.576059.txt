Assuming the person is salaried, she should start by contributing to a 401k or other retirement plan, if her employer offers one. If not, she should open an IRA and contribute to that. She should also have an emergency fund of at least three months' living expenses. Once she has these things in place, she can start working on her financial goals.

For her financial goals, she should first figure out how much money she will need and create a savings plan to reach that goal. She should also consider investing her money to potentially earn higher returns. For example, she could invest in a vacation rental property or a stock portfolio.
