Assuming this person is single: 

The first step is to figure out what your financial goals are. In this case, the goal is to save up for a vacation. To do this, you will need to create a budget and stick to it. 

To create a budget, track all of your income and expenses for one month. This will give you a good idea of where your money is going. Once you know where your money is going, you can start to cut back on expenses in order to save money for your vacation. 

Some suggestions for cutting back on expenses include eating out less, cooking at home more, and avoiding unnecessary purchases. You should also try to get rid of any debt you have, as this will free up more money to save.

If your goal is to save up for a specific vacation, you should figure out how much the trip will cost and then create a savings plan accordingly. For example, if the trip will cost $2000, you should plan to save $200 per month for 10 months. This may require some sacrifice, but it will be worth it in the end!
