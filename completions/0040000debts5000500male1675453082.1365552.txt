Assuming that this person has no other debts, the first thing I would recommend is to create a budget. This will help to get a clear understanding of where their money is going each month and where they can cut back in order to save. I would also recommend looking into investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds in order to build up their savings. Finally, I would advise this person to create a plan to pay off their debts as quickly as possible. This may involve making some sacrifices in their monthly budget, but it will be worth it in the long run.
