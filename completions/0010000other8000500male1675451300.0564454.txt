Assuming this person is single:

The first step is to try and reduce your monthly expenses. You can do this by cutting back on unnecessary costs, such as entertainment and eating out. You should also make sure to put away some money each month into savings.

Investing your money is a good way to grow your wealth over time. However, since you are not currently seeing any returns from your investments, you may want to consider other options. One option could be to use your savings to pay down your rent or monthly expenses.

You should also have financial goals set so that you know what you are working towards. Others goals may include building up an emergency fund, purchasing a home, or saving for retirement. Financial goals will help you stay on track and make better decisions with your money.
