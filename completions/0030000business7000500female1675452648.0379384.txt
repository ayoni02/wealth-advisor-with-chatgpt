1. Invest in a Roth IRA account. A Roth IRA is an individual retirement account that offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The initial investment can be made with after-tax dollars, and the account can grow tax-free.

2. Invest in a diversified stock portfolio. A diversified stock portfolio will offer the potential for long-term growth.

3. Save regularly. This person should set up a regular savings plan and make sure to contribute to it regularly.

4. Review expenses and cut unnecessary costs. This person should take a close look at their monthly expenses and see where they can cut back.
