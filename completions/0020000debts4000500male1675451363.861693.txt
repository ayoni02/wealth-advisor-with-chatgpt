Assuming this person is single:

The first thing this person should do is assess his current financial situation and develop a budget. This will help him to get a better understanding of where his money is going and where he can cut back. Once he has a budget in place, he should work on paying off his debts. He may want to consider consolidating his debts into one monthly payment to make it easier to manage. He should also make sure to continue to save money each month so that he can build up his savings and eventually achieve his financial goals.
