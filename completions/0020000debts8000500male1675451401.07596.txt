First and foremost, you need to get your financial situation under control. You are currently spending more money than you are bringing in, and that is not sustainable. You need to either increase your income or decrease your expenses in order to start saving money.

One of the best ways to save money is to create a budget and stick to it. Track your expenses for a month and then create a budget based on your needs and wants. Make sure to include all of your necessary expenses, such as rent and food, as well as your debts. Once you have a budget, try to stick to it as closely as possible.

Also, start paying off your debts as soon as possible. The sooner you can get rid of your debts, the less money you will have to spend on interest payments. Try to make more than the minimum payment each month, and focus on paying off the debts with the highest interest rates first.

Finally, start investing your money. Investing is a great way to grow your wealth over time, and it can be one of the best uses of your money. Investing can be done in many different ways, so research different options and choose the one that best suits your needs.

By following these financial tips, you can get your finances under control and start working towards your financial goals.
