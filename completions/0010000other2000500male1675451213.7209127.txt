If you are a male with a salary of 10000 and no returns from investment, rent of 2000, monthly expenses of 500, and no savings, you should consider the following financial advice. You should save as much money as possible every month so that you can eventually buy a house or apartment outright. Alternatively, you should invest your money so that you can make returns and use those returns to cover your rent or other monthly expenses. You should also try to pay off any debt that you have so that you can be financially free.
