Assuming you would like specific advice for this person: 

The first step would be to create a budget. Track all income and expenses for at least one month to get an accurate idea of where the money is going. Once that is done, work on cutting down expenses in order to increase the amount of money that can be saved each month. 

It is also important to create financial goals and make a plan on how to achieve them. In this case, the goal is to buy a car. Figure out how much money will need to be saved in order to make the purchase within a reasonable time frame. Automating savings by setting up a direct deposit from each paycheck into a separate savings account can be helpful. 

Investing is another key component of financial planning. Even with a salary of $30,000, there are likely still opportunities to invest money and grow wealth over time. Working with a financial advisor can be helpful in determining the best way to invest. 

 Ultimately, financial success requires both short-term and long-term planning. Making small tweaks to spending and saving habits can have a big impact down the road.
