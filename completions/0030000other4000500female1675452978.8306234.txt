The first thing you should do is sit down and make a budget. Determine what your monthly after-tax income is and track where every dollar goes. This will help you get a better sense of where your money is going and where you can cut back. Once you have a budget in place, you can start working on building up your savings. Try to have at least 3-6 months of living expenses saved so that you have a cushion in case of an emergency.

If you don't have any returns from investments, you may want to consider investing some of your money. A financial advisor can help you determine what the best options are for you, based on your goals and risk tolerance.

Since you are renting, you are not building any equity in a property. If you have the ability to do so, you may want to consider purchasing a home instead. Not only will you build equity, but you may also be able to take advantage of tax deductions.

In general, it is a good idea to try to keep your monthly expenses as low as possible. Consider ways that you can cut back, such as eating out less or downgrading your cable package. Any extra money that you can put towards savings or investments will help you reach your financial goals.
