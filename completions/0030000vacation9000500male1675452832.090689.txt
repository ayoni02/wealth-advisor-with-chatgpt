If you are a male with a salary of $30000 and your investment returns are $0, your monthly rent is $9000 and your monthly expenses are $500, you have no savings and you want to go on vacation, here is some financial advice.

First, you should try to increase your savings. You can do this by setting aside a certain amount of money each month to put into savings. You may also want to look into investing in some higher-yielding investments, such as stocks or mutual funds, to help increase your savings.

Second, you should try to reduce your monthly expenses. One way to do this is to cut back on your discretionary spending, such as entertainment, travel, and dining out. Another way to reduce your expenses is to negotiate with your landlord for a lower rent.

Third, you should create a budget to help you track your spending and make sure you are not overspending. A budget can also help you see where you can cut back on your expenses.

Fourth, you should consider your financial goals and make sure you are on track to reach them. If you are not on track to reach your goals, you may need to adjust your budget or savings plan.

 Fifth, if you have any debt, you should try to pay it off as soon as possible. Debt can be a major burden and can prevent you from reaching your financial goals.

By following these tips, you can improve your financial situation and reach your financial goals.
