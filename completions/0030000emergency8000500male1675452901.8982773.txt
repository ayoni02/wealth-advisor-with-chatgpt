Start by creating a budget. Though you may not be able to save much each month, it is important to save what you can. An emergency fund is a good financial goal to have. Try to save at least 3-6 months of living expenses in case of job loss or other unforeseen circumstances.

 Investing is a good way to grow your wealth over time. However, if you have no returns from your investments, you may want to reconsider your investment strategy.

Think about ways to lower your monthly expenses. Perhaps you can find a cheaper place to live or get rid of unnecessary expenses.

If you are struggling to make ends meet, consider getting a part-time job or finding other sources of income. Financial assistance programs may also be available to help you cover your basic needs.
