Assuming you would like tips for improving the person's financial situation: 

1. Invest in a high yield savings account or a short-term bond fund to earn a higherreturn on your savings.

2. Consider contributing to a Roth IRA. With a Roth IRA, your contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but you can withdraw the money tax-free in retirement.

3. Make sure you are taking advantage of any employer matching contributions to your retirement savings plan.

4. Review your expenses and see where you can cut back, even by a small amount. Every little bit saved can add up over time.

5. Make a budget and stick to it. This will help you track your expenses and ensure that you are not spending more than you can afford.
