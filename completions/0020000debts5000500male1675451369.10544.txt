In order to get your finances in order, you need to develop a budget and stick to it. Begin by evaluating your monthly income and expenses. Try to find ways to reduce your expenses, such as eating out less or cutting back on entertainment. Once you have a good handle on your monthly budget, you can begin to focus on your financial goals. If you are carrying any high-interest debt, such as credit card debt, you should focus on paying that off as quickly as possible. Once you are debt-free, you can start saving for other financial goals, such as retirement or a rainy day fund.
