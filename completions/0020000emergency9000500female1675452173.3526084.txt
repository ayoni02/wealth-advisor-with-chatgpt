There are a few things that this person can do in order to improve their financial situation.

First, they should try to increase their salary if possible. If they are unable to do this, they should try to save as much money as possible from their current salary. They should also look into investing their money in order to try to grow their savings.

In addition, this person should try to reduce their monthly expenses as much as possible. They should look at their current expenses and see if there are any areas where they can cut back. For example, they may be able to save money on their monthly food budget by cooking at home more often.

Finally, this person should have a financial goal in mind, such as creating an emergency fund. They should save up money each month until they reach their goal. Once they have reached their goal, they can start working on other financial goals, such as saving for retirement.
