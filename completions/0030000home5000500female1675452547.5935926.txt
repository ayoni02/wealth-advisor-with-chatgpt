Assuming this person is single: 

A good first step would be to create a budget to see where all of her money is going each month. This will help her to get a better idea of her monthly expenses and where she can cut back if necessary. It is also important to make sure that she is building up her emergency fund so that she has money to cover unexpected costs in the future.

In terms of her financial goals, saving for a home can be a great long-term investment. She may want to consider opening a savings account specifically for this purpose and contributing to it on a regular basis. She may also want to research different mortgage options and work out how much she would need to save for a down payment.
