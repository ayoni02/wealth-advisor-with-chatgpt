First and foremost, it’s important to have a clear understanding of your financial situation. This includes knowing your monthly income, expenses, and debts. Once you have a clear understanding of your overall financial picture, you can start working towards specific financial goals.

In this case, the individual has a monthly income of $10,000 and monthly expenses of $500. Their rent is $6,000 per month, which leaves them with $4,000 to save or invest each month.

If the individual’s goal is to start a business, it’s important to save as much money as possible to give yourself a cushion in case things don’t go as planned. It’s also a good idea to speak with a financial advisor to get a better understanding of how to invest your money to reach your goals.
