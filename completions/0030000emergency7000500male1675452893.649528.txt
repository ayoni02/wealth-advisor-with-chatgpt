Assuming this person is single: 

1. Make sure you have an emergency fund of 3-6 months of living expenses saved up. This will give you a cushion in case you lose your job or have unexpected expenses.

2. Invest in yourself by taking courses or learning new skills that can help you earn more money.

3. Try to bring your monthly expenses down to below your salary, so that you can use the extra money to pay off debt or save for your future.

4. Invest in a mix of different types of investments, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, to help you reach your financial goals.

5. Meet with a financial advisor to discuss your specific situation and goals, and to get personalized advice.
