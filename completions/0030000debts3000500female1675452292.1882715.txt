First, work on building up your savings so that you have a cushion to fall back on in case of any unforeseen expenses. Try to put away at least 10% of your salary each month into savings.

Next, focus on paying down your debts. Make a budget and figure out how much you can realistically afford to put towards your debts each month. Once you have a plan in place, stick to it!

Finally, if you have any extra money each month after you have saved and paid down your debts, think about investing it. Investing can help you build your wealth over time and reach your financial goals.
