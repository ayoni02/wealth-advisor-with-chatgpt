Assuming you would like advice for this person in general and not just for their financial goal, here are a few pieces of advice: 

-Save: It is important to have money saved up for unexpected events such as job loss, medical bills, or car repairs. Try to have at least 3-6 months of living expenses saved up. 

-Reduce expenses: Take a look at your monthly expenses and see where you can cut back. Even small changes can make a big difference in your overall financial picture. 

- Invest: While this personâ€™s current investments are not yielding any returns, it is important to continue to invest for the future. Consider investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds to help diversify your portfolio. 

-Create a budget: A budget can help you track your spending and ensure that you are living within your means. Make sure to include all of your income and expenses in your budget, including rent, utilities, transportation, food, and entertainment. 

-Set financial goals: In addition to your long-term goal of taking a vacation, consider setting other financial goals. These could include saving for a down payment on a house or investing for retirement. Having specific goals will help you stay on track with your finances.
