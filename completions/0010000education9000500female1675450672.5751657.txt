1. The first step is to save up some money for your future goals. Try to set aside at least 10% of your monthly income into savings so that you can have a nest egg to fall back on.

2. Next, you need to invest this money wisely. Talk to a financial advisor about how you can best grow your money over time. They can help you pick solid investments that will give you good returns.

3. Once you have a good savings and investment plan in place, start working on paying down your rent. This will free up more of your monthly income to save and invest. You may even be able to get a lower interest rate on your rentals if you have a good credit score.

4. Finally, be sure to keep your monthly expenses in check. Track where your money is going and see where you can cut back. This will help you free up even more money to save and invest for your future.
