Assuming you would like comprehensive financial advice for this person: 

The first thing to do is to make sure that you are bringing in more money than you are spending each month. Even if it is only a small amount, it is important to start building up your savings. One way to do this is to make sure that you are automatically transferring a fixed percentage of your income into savings each month. This way, you will not be tempted to spend it on other things.

It is also important to start investing your money. Even if you are only able to invest a small amount each month, it is important to start building up your investment portfolio. One way to do this is to invest in a mutual fund. A mutual fund is a type of investment where your money is pooled together with other investors and then invested in a variety of different securities, such as stocks and bonds. This is a good way to diversify your investment portfolio and to start building up your investment capital.

Another important thing to do is to make sure that you are effectively managing your debt. If you have any high interest debt, such as credit card debt, it is important to focus on paying this off as quickly as possible. One way to do this is to make a budget and to make sure that you are allocating a fixed amount of money each month towards paying off your debt.

Finally, it is also important to have financial goals. It is helpful to set both short-term and long-term financial goals. For example, a short-term goal could be to save up for a down payment on a house. A long-term goal could be to save up for retirement. By having financial goals, you will be more motivated to save and invest your money.
