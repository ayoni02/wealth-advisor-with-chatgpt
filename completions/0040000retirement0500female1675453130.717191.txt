Assuming this person would like good comprehensive financial advice, some key points to consider would be the following: 

-First and foremost, this person should focus on building up her emergency fund. A good rule of thumb is to have 3-6 months' worth of living expenses saved in a readily accessible account, in case of job loss or unexpected expenses. This will help her to stay afloat financially if she experiences a setback.

-Secondly, she should focus on maxing out her retirement accounts. Both a 401k and an IRA are excellent ways to save for retirement and take advantage of tax breaks. Employer matching programs make 401ks especially attractive.

-Thirdly, she should focus on building up her Credit score. A good credit score will help her get better interest rates on loans and lines of credit, which can save her money in the long run.

-Fourth, she should create a budget and stick to it. This will help her to track her expenses and make sure that she is not overspending.

-Last but not least, she should start investing. Investing her money will help it to grow over time, and she can use it to reach her financial goals.
