Assuming you would like specific financial advice for the person described: 

The first step is to create a budget. You will need to track your monthly income and expenses in order to get a clear picture of your finances. This will help you identify any areas where you may be able to cut back on spending in order to save more money.

Next, you will need to focus on building up your savings. You should aim to have at least 3-6 months of living expenses saved in an emergency fund. This will give you a cushion to fall back on if you encounter any unexpected financial setbacks.

Once you have built up your savings, you can start thinking about investing your money. Returns from investments can help you reach your financial goals quicker. However, you should only invest money that you are comfortable with losing, as there is always some risk involved.

Finally, you should always keep your financial goals in mind and review your progress regularly. This will help you stay on track and make adjustments to your budget or savings plan as needed.
