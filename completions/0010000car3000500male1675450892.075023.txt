The first thing you should do is figure out your net income. This is your salary after taxes. From there, you should create a budget. Track your monthly expenses and see where you can cut back. Try to put away at least 10% of your income into savings. This will help you reach your financial goals quicker. Investing is also a good idea. Try to put away money into an investment account each month. Over time, these investments will grow and can provide you with additional income.
