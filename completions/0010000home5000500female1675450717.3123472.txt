Assuming you would like tips for improving this person's financial situation: 

Build an emergency fund: An emergency fund should cover three to six months of living expenses in case of a job loss or unexpected medical bills. This will help to reduce stress and anxiety around money.

Save for specific goals: In addition to an emergency fund, it's important to save for specific goals. This could include a down payment on a house, a new car, or retirement. Having a goal in mind will help to stay motivated to save.

Create a budget: A budget can help to track income and expenses to make sure that there is enough money to cover all of the monthly bills. Any extra money can be used to save or pay off debt.

Reduce expenses: One way to free up more money to save is to reduce expenses. This could include eating out less, cutting back on unnecessary purchases, or downsizing to a smaller apartment.

Increase income: Another way to save more money is to bring in more money. This could include getting a promotion at work, getting a second job, or earning money through side hustles.
