Start by looking at your financial goals. If you want to start a business, you will need to save up some money for startup costs. Talk to a financial advisor about how much you will need to save and how to best invest your money.

Next, look at your monthly expenses and try to cut back where you can. If you are spending $500 a month on unnecessary expenses, that is $6,000 a year that could be going towards your business or other financial goals.

Finally, think about ways to increase your income. If you are only making $3,000 a month, it will be difficult to reach your financial goals. Consider looking for a new job or ways to make extra money.
