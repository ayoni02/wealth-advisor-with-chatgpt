There are a few things that this person can do in order to improve their financial situation.

First, they should try to increase their salary if possible. If they are unable to do this, they should try to cut their monthly expenses by cutting down on non-essential items. They should also try to increase their returns from investment by investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.

They should also put some of their money into savings each month so that they can build up a nest egg for retirement. They should try to save at least 10% of their income each month.

Finally, they should develop a financial plan that outlines their goals and how they plan to achieve them. This plan should include a budget and a savings plan. They should review their plan regularly and make adjustments as necessary.
