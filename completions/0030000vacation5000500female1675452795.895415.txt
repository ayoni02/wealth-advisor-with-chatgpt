First and foremost, always remember to save! Try to have at least 3-6 months of living expenses put away in savings in case of an unforeseen event.

Since you have a monthly expenses of $500, you should be able to save $250 a month. Try to put this into a high yield savings account so that you can earn some interest on your savings.

For your financial goals, since you would like to go on a vacation, start by setting aside $100 a month into a separate savings account. This way you can easily track your progress. Once you have saved up $1,000, you can start looking into trip options.

To help boost your savings, you may want to look into getting a higher paying job. Alternatively, you could look into ways to reduce your monthly expenses. For example, you could get a roommate to help split the cost of rent and bills.
