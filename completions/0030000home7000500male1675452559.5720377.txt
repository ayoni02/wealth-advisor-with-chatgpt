The most important thing for this person to do is to create a budget and stick to it. Make sure that your monthly expenses do not exceed your income and that you are saving something each month. Investing is also important, but with a salary of only $30000, it may be best to focus on saving for now rather than trying to make money through investments. One financial goal could be to save up for a down payment on a home. This could take a few years, but it is important to have a goal in mind. Another goal could be to create an emergency fund, which would help if you ever ran into financial difficulty.
