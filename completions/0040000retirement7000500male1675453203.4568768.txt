Assuming that this person wants good comprehensive financial advice, here are a few pieces of advice that could be given:

1. Make a budget: Understand what your fixed costs are (e.g. rent) and what your variable costs are (e.g. food, transportation). Make sure to track your spending so that you can see where your money is going.

2. Invest in yourself: One of the best investments you can make is in yourself. Consider investing in your education or career development. This can help you increase your earnings potential and set yourself up for a more secure financial future.

3. Begin saving for retirement: It’s never too early to start saving for retirement. Even if you can only save a small amount each month, it will add up over time. Try to automate your savings so that you don’t have to think about it – this can help you stay on track.

4. Invest wisely: When it comes to investing, there is no “sure thing”. However, you can increase your chances of success by doing your research and investing in a diversified mix of assets.

5. Protect yourself: Make sure you have adequate insurance coverage. This can help you financially if you experience an unexpected health setback or other unforeseen event.

6. Live below your means: One of the best ways to stay on top of your finances is to live below your means. This means spending less than you earn and being mindful of your spending. It can be difficult to do, but it’s worth it in the long run.

7. Make a plan: Having a financial plan can help you stay organized and on track with your finances. Make sure to review your goals regularly and make changes to your plan as needed.

Following these pieces of advice can help you get your finances on track and set yourself up for a more secure financial future.
