The first step would be to create a budget. Include your fixed costs like rent/mortgage and utilities, as well as your variable costs like food and gas. Make sure to also include your debt payments, savings goals, and any other expenses you might have. Once you have your budget, you can look at ways to reduce your expenses and increase your income.

If you are only making $20000 a year, it is likely that you will not be able to save much money each month. However, you can still focus on paying down your debt. Make a list of all of your debts, including the interest rate, minimum payment, and balance. Then, focus on paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first. You may also want to consider a debt consolidation loan to reduce your monthly payments.

Investing is another important part of financial planning, even if you don't have much money to invest. Investing can help you reach your financial goals, whether you're trying to save for retirement or pay off debt. A good financial advisor can help you create an investing plan that fits your goals and your budget.
