If you are a female with a salary of $20000, your returns from investment may be zero, rent may be $1000, and your monthly expenses could be $500. You may not have any savings, but you do want to buy a car. Here is some comprehensive financial advice. Try to save 10% of your income each month. Invest in a 401k or similar retirement account offered through your employer. If you can afford it, try to pay off your rent or mortgage as quickly as possible. Make a budget and track your spending to see where you can cut back. Try to pay off any debts that you have, including credit cards and student loans. If you can, try to save up for a down payment on a car. Look for ways to increase your income, such as getting a raise or starting a side hustle. Financial goals are important, but remember to also focus on building up your savings and reducing your debts.
