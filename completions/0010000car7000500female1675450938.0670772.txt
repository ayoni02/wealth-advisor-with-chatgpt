There are a few things to consider when giving financial advice to someone in this situation. The first is their goals. It is important to set realistic financial goals in order to stay on track and make progress. For example, if the person's goal is to buy a car, they should set a target savings amount and make a plan for how they will save up the money.

Another important consideration is the person's monthly expenses. In order to save money and reach their financial goals, it is important to reduce unnecessary expenses and live within their means. One way to do this is to create a budget and track their spending. This will help them to be aware of where their money is going and make adjustments as needed.

Finally, it is also important to invest money wisely. Although the person in this situation has not had any returns from their investments yet, it is still important to consider this as a part of their financial plan. They should research different investment options and choose those that align with their goals and risk tolerance.
