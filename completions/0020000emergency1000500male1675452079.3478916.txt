Assuming you would like tips for the individual with the above circumstances, here are a few recommendations: 

1. Establish an emergency fund: This should be a priority for anyone, regardless of their financial circumstances. An emergency fund acts as a buffer against unexpected expenses or income interruptions. A good rule of thumb is to have 3-6 months of living expenses saved. 

2. Review your expenses: Take a close look at your monthly spending and see where you can cut back. Even small changes can make a big difference in your overall financial picture. 

3. Invest in yourself: One of the best investments you can make is in yourself. Consider taking courses or pursuing education that can help you earn more money in the long run. 

4. Take advantage of employer benefits: If your employer offers any type of retirement savings plan, take advantage of it. Many employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money. 

5. Live below your means: This is probably the most important tip of all. It’s easy to fall into the trap of lifestyle inflation, but it’s important to remember that your lifestyle should not exceed your means. Live within your means and save as much money as possible.
