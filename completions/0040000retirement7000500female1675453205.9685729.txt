Assuming this person is unmarried:

The best financial advice for this person would be to focus on building up her savings and retirement fund as much as possible. She should aim to save at least 10% of her salary each month, and invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other retirement vehicles that will give her the best chance of achieving her financial goals. She should also make sure to keep her monthly expenses in check, and avoid taking on any unnecessary debt.
