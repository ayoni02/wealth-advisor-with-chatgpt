Assuming this person is looking for financial advice in regards to their goal of taking a vacation, here are a few pieces of advice that could be given: 

1. Attempt to increase your salary if possible - whether through earning a promotion or finding a new, higher-paying job. This will give you a larger sum of money to work with each month and make it easier to save up for your vacation.

2. Try to reduce your monthly expenses as much as possible. Look for ways to cut back on things like eating out, entertainment, and unnecessary shopping. This will free up more money each month that can be put towards your vacation fund.

3. Begin investing your money instead of keeping it in savings. Although the return on investment may be low at first, over time it can compound and grow significantly. This will give you more money to work with when it comes time to take your vacation.

4. Make a budget for your vacation fund and stick to it. Determine how much you need to save each month in order to reach your goal within a reasonable time frame. Then, make a concerted effort to stick to that budget and avoid overspending.

By following these pieces of advice, you can put yourself in a much better financial position to take your dream vacation.
