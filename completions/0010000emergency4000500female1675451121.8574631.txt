There are a few things to consider when giving financial advice to someone with this financial situation. The first is to create a budget and track expenses so that you are aware of where your money is going each month. This will help to make sure that you are not overspending and that you are staying on track with your monthly expenses. It is also important to have an emergency fund in place in case something unexpected comes up. This will help to cover unexpected costs and keep you from getting into debt. Finally, it is also a good idea to invest in your future by saving for retirement. This can be done through a retirement account such as a 401k or an IRA.
