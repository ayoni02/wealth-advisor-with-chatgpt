Assuming this person wants good financial advice, here are some suggestions: 

1. Review your monthly expenses and make changes where necessary. It may be possible to reduce your monthly expenses by cutting back on unnecessary spending or by finding cheaper alternatives for certain items.

2. Begin saving as much money as possible. Even if you can only save a small amount each month, it will add up over time. Try to have at least three monthsâ€™ worth of living expenses saved so that you have a cushion in case of an emergency.

3. Invest your money wisely. Consider investing in a mix of stocks and bonds to help grow your savings. Working with a financial advisor can help you make the best investment choices for your goals.

4. Make a budget and stick to it. Determine how much you can realistically afford to save and invest each month, and then make a plan to stick to it. Review your budget regularly to make sure you are on track.

5. Stay disciplined with your finances. It can be easy to give into temptation and spend money on unnecessary things. However, if you stay disciplined and focus on your financial goals, you will be more likely to achieve them.
