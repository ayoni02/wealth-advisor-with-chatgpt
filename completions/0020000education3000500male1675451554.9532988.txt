Assuming you would like personal finance advice for the individual with the given financial situation: 

It is always a good idea to start by looking at your monthly expenses and see where you can cut back in order to increase your savings. For example, the individual may want to consider cooking at home more often instead of eating out, or cutting back on unnecessary expenses such as subscriptions or memberships. 

Setting financial goals is also important in order to stay on track and motivated. In this case, the individual’s goal is to save for education. A good way to do this is to set up a dedicated savings account for this purpose and make regular deposits. The individual may also want to consider automating their savings so that a fixed amount is transferred from their checking account to their savings account every month. 

Investing is another way to grow your money, although the individual’s current situation of earning no returns from investment may be due to the fact that they are not investing in the right places. It is important to do your research and explore different options before investing, as well as to monitor your investments regularly to ensure that they are performing well. 

Overall, it is important to be mindful of your spending, set financial goals, and invest wisely in order to achieve financial success.
