Assuming you would like advice for this person: 

Firstly, it is always good to have savings in case of any emergencies that may come up. Try to have at least 3-6 months of living expenses saved so that you are covered if you were to lose your job or have any major unexpected expenses. 

Secondly, it is also a good idea to invest some money in addition to saving. While there may not be any immediate returns, over time investments typically go up in value, so you will end up with more money than you originally invested. 

Thirdly, if you have any financial goals, such as buying a home, it is important to start working towards those as soon as possible. In this case, you should start looking into saving for a down payment on a home. Even if you are not able to buy a home right away, the sooner you start saving, the more time you will have to save up. 

Fourthly, it is important to keep track of your monthly expenses so that you do not overspend. Once you know how much you are spending each month, you can start to look for ways to reduce your expenses. For example, you could start cooking at home more instead of going out to eat, or you could see if there are any subscriptions or memberships that you no longer use and cancel them. 

Overall, it is important to be aware of your financial situation and to make sure that you are taking care of your finances. By following these tips, you can help to improve your financial situation and reach your financial goals.
