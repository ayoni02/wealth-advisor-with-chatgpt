First, you should assess your current financial situation and figure out where you can cut back on expenses in order to save more money. Try to put away at least 10% of your income into savings so that you have a cushion to fall back on in case of emergencies. If you can, try to invest some money so that you can grow your savings even more.

Once you have a better handle on your finances, you can start thinking about your long-term goals. If you want to start your own business, start by researching the best business opportunities for women and how to get started. Also, make sure to create a realistic business plan and budget so that you know exactly how much money you will need to get started. Finally, don't forget to save some money for marketing and advertising so that you can attract customers and grow your business.
