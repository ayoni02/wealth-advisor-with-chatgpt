The first thing this person needs to do is to figure out what their financial goals are. If their goal is to pay off debts, they need to create a budget and figure out how much they need to pay each month to pay off their debts within a reasonable amount of time. They also need to make sure that they are not spending more than they are earning each month. If they are, they need to either find a way to make more money or cut back on their expenses.

Once they have a budget in place, they need to start working on building up their savings. Even if it is only a small amount, it is important to start saving for future goals. They should also try to invest their money in something that will give them a return, even if it is only a small amount. This will help them to reach their financial goals quicker.
