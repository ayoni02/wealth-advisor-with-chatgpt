Assuming this person's financial situation is static, meaning their salary and monthly expenses will not change in the future, here is some financial advice for them.

1. Invest in yourself by taking courses or learning new skills that can help you earn a higher salary.

2. Make a budget and track your spending to see where you can cut back in order to save more money each month.

3. Invest in a solid financial education so that you can make better decisions with your money in the future.

4. Start saving for your financial goals, such as education, as soon as possible. The sooner you start saving, the more money you will have available to reach your goals.

5. Seek professional help if you need assistance in developing a financial plan or reaching your financial goals.
