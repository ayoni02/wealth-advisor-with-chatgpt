Start by looking at your monthly expenses and work on ways to reduce them. Try to bring your expenses down to a level that is more manageable and that will allow you to put some money into savings each month. Next, focus on paying down your debts. You may want to consider consolidating your debts into one loan with a lower interest rate to make your payments more manageable. Once you have made some headway in reducing your expenses and paying down your debts, you can start to focus on saving for your future. Begin by setting aside a small amount each month into savings and then increase the amount as you are able. Investing your money wisely will help you to reach your financial goals.
