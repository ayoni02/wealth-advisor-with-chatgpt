There are a few things to consider when giving financial advice to someone in this situation. First, the person's salary is relatively low, so it is important to be mindful of their monthly expenses. Second, the person's investment returns are zero, so they may need to consider other options for growing their savings. Finally, the person's financial goal is to buy a home, so they will need to save up a significant amount of money for a down payment.

One of the most important things the person can do is to create a budget and stick to it. This will help them to be aware of their spending and make sure that their monthly expenses are not exceeding their income. They should also continue to look for ways to grow their savings, even if their investment returns are low. One option could be to open a high-yield savings account or to invest in a short-term certificate of deposit. Lastly, they will need to start saving as much as possible for their down payment on a home. Even if it takes a few years to save up, it will be worth it in the end.
