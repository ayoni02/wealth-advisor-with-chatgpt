Assuming this person has no debt, my advice would be as follows: 

-Save as much as possible each month. Try to put away at least 10-15% of your monthly income into savings. This will help you reach your financial goal sooner. 

-Invest your money wisely. Research different investment options and speak with a financial advisor to find out what would be the best options for you. A diversified portfolio is always a good idea. 

-Reduce your monthly expenses as much as possible. Track where you are spending your money and see where you can cut back, even by a little bit. Every little bit helps! 

-Create a budget and stick to it. This will help you stay on track with your finances and reach your goals.
