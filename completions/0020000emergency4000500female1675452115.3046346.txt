This person's financial situation is not ideal, and she should take some steps to improve it. She should first work on building up her savings, so that she has a cushion to fall back on in case of an emergency. She should also consider investing her money, so that she can grow her wealth over time. Finally, she should try to reduce her monthly expenses, so that she can free up more money to save and invest.
