1. The first thing you need to do is create a budget. This will help you see where your money is going and where you can cut back. Make sure to include all of your income and all of your expenses, including rent, Utilities, groceries, transportation, and entertainment.

2. Once you have a budget, you need to start looking at your financial goals. If you want to start a business, you need to save money. Figure out how much you need to save each month to reach your goal.

3. Investing is a great way to grow your money. However, if you don't have any returns from investment, you may want to consider other options. One option is to put your money into a high-yield savings account. This will help you earn more interest on your money.

4. Make sure you are contributing to a retirement account. This is one of the most important financial goals you can have. You want to make sure you have enough money saved up so that you can retire comfortably.

5. Lastly, if you have any debt, you want to start paying it off as soon as possible. The sooner you can get rid of your debt, the better off you will be financially.
