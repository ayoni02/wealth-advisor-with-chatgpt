There are a few things to consider when giving financial advice to someone in this situation. The first thing to do is help them create a budget. This will help them track their expenses and income, as well as see where they can cut back in order to save more money. It is also important to encourage them to start investing their money, even if it is just a small amount each month. This will help them grow their savings over time and reach their financial goals. Finally, it is important to provide guidance on how to be smart with their money in general. This includes things like being mindful of impulse purchases and avoiding debt.
