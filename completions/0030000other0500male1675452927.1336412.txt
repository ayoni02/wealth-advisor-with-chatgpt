Assuming this person's only goal is to "other," some possible advice for them would be as follows:

-Save: Try to break the habit of spending everything and/or swallowing credit card debts. Attain a long-term savings plan of at least 3 to 6 months' worth of living expenses.

-Budget: Track where every dollar goes. Determine what expenses are essential and what can be reduced or eliminated. This will help to free up more money to save.

-Reduce debts: Any debts, especially high-interest ones, should be paid off as soon as possible. This will reduce the amount of money spent on interest payments and free up more money for savings.

-Build credit: Use credit wisely by always making payments on time and in full. This will help to build a good credit history, which will be beneficial in the future.

-Invest: Consider investing in a diversified mix of assets, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. This can help to grow wealth over time and provide financial security in the future.
