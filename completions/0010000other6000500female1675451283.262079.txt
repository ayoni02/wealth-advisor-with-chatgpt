Based on the information provided, the person has very little savings and is currently spending more than they are bringing in each month. This is not a sustainable financial situation and something needs to be done in order to change it. The first step would be to cut back on expenses in order to lower the amount of money going out each month. Perhaps the person could look for a cheaper place to live or get rid of any unnecessary expenses. Once the monthly expenses are lowered, the person can start to focus on saving money each month. Even if it is just a small amount, it is important to start putting money away so that there is something to fall back on in case of an emergency. The person should also consider investing some money so that they can grow their savings over time. If the person has financial goals, they should make a plan for how to achieve them. This may include setting up a budget and sticking to it, as well as making wise choices with their money.
