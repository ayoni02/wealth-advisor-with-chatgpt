Assuming that this person's only source of income is their salary, and they have no savings, they will need to be very mindful of their expenses in order to achieve their financial goals. Make sure to track all expenses, including rent, so that you can see where your money is going each month. Try to reduce unnecessary expenses, and if possible, increase your income by working overtime or finding a side hustle. Investing may also be a good option, but be sure to do your research before making any decisions.
