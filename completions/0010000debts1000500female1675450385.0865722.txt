If you are a female with a salary of $10,000 and no returns from investments, you should focus on paying off your debts. Try to cut down on your monthly expenses by $500 and put that money towards your debts. You may also want to consider getting a part-time job to help pay off your debts faster. Once your debts are paid off, you can start saving for your other financial goals.
