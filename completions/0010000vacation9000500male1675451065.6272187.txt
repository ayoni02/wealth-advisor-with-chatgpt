It's important to have financial goals in order to save effectively. In this case, the goal is a vacation. The individual should break down the cost of the vacation and determine how much needs to be saved each month in order to reach their goal within a certain time frame.

Assuming the person is earning a salary of $10,000 and has no other sources of income, they will need to save $833 per month to reach their goal in one year. This may seem like a daunting task, but there are a few ways to make it more manageable.

First, the individual should try to reduce their monthly expenses. Even small cuts can add up over time and free up more money to put towards savings. Additionally, the individual could look into earning additional income through side hustles or other means. Even an extra $100 per month can make a big difference in the long run.

Once the individual has determined how much they can realistically save each month, they should open a dedicated savings account and automate their deposits. This way, the money will be out of sight and out of mind, making it less tempting to spend.

Last but not least, the individual should stayed focused on their goal. It can be helpful to remind yourself why you're saving in the first place and what you'll be able to do with the money once you reach your goal.
