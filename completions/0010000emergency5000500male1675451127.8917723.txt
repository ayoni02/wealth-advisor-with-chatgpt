The first thing to do is to create a budget. This will help you to track your monthly expenses and see where you can cut back in order to save more money. You should try to have at least 3-6 months of living expenses saved in an emergency fund in case something unexpected comes up.

Another good piece of advice is to invest your money. Even if you don't have a lot to invest, you can start small and gradually grow your investment portfolio over time. This will help you to reach your financial goals quicker.

 Lastly, try to live below your means. Just because you have a high salary doesn't mean that you need to spend all of it. Try to save as much money as possible so that you can reach your financial goals sooner.
