Assuming you would like advice for the person with the above financial situation: 

Although you may feel like you are not making headway, it is important to continue saving as much money as possible. Try to set aside at least 10% of your salary each month into a savings account. If you can do more, great, but make sure you are at least putting away this amount. This will help you build up a cushion in case of any emergencies, and it will also help you reach your financial goals quicker. 

If you are not already doing so, try to invest some of your money each month. Even if the returns are small at first, over time they can add up. Investing is a great way to grow your money over time, and it can eventually help you reach your goal of retirement. 

Finally, be mindful of your monthly expenses. Just because you have a high salary doesnâ€™t mean you have to spend all of it. Try to live below your means and be mindful of your spending. If you can cut down on your monthly expenses, you will be in a much better financial position.
