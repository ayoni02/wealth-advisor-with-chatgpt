It is important to have an emergency fund in case of job loss or unexpected medical bills. Try to save at least 3-6 months of living expenses. Invest in a high yield savings account or short-term CD for emergency savings.

For long-term savings goals, invest in a diversified mix of stocks and bonds. Consider using a tax-advantaged retirement account such as a 401(k) or IRA. If your employer offers a match, be sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of it.

For monthly expenses, cut unnecessary costs and try to save 10-15% of your income. Automate your savings so that it is transferred to a separate account each month. Review your expenses regularly to see where you can make cuts.

Consider meeting with a financial advisor to discuss your financial goals and how to best achieve them.
