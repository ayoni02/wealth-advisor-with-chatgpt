The first step is to develop a budget. This will help you to get a clear idea of your monthly income and expenses. Once you have a budget, you can start working on your financial goals.

If you have no savings, you should start by putting away some money each month into a savings account. You should also look into investing some of your money into a retirement account such as a 401k or IRA.

Education is a great financial goal to have. You should start by looking into grants and scholarships that you may be eligible for. You may also want to consider taking out a student loan to help with the costs of your education.

Overall, it is important to be mindful of your spending and to make sure that you are putting away money each month in order to reach your financial goals.
