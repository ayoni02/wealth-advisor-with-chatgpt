First, the person should save up at least 3 months' worth of living expenses in case of an emergency. This will help ensure that she can cover her basic costs if she unexpectedly loses her job or has some other financial setback.

Second, she should start investing her money to try to grow her savings. Even if she only earns a small return on her investment, it will be better than leaving her money in a savings account where it will only earn interest at the current low rates.

Third, she should create a budget and track her spending to ensure that she is not spending more than she can afford. If she can stick to her budget and keep her spending under control, she will be in a better position to save money and reach her financial goals.
