If you are a woman with a salary of $10,000 and no other income, you should focus on building up your savings. You should try to put away as much money as possible each month, so that you have a cushion to fall back on in case of an emergency. You should also have specific financial goals in mind, such as saving for a down payment on a house or funding your education. Once you have a solid savings account, you can start investing your money and earning returns that can help you reach your goals even faster.
