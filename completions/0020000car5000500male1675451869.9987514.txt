Assuming that this person is not in any debt, my advice would be as follows. 

1) Make saving a priority: The first step to building wealth is to make saving a regular habit. I recommend setting aside at least 10% of your income each month into savings. This will help you build up a financial cushion in case of an unexpected emergency and also start to grow your wealth over time.

2) Invest your savings: Once you have built up a reasonable amount of savings, you can start investing your money to grow your wealth even further. There are many different ways to invest your money, so it is important to do some research and figure out what investment strategy makes the most sense for you.

3) Make a budget: In order to make sure that you are staying on track with your finances, it is important to create a budget and stick to it. This budget should detail all of your income and expenses so that you can see exactly where your money is going each month. Additionally, if you find that you are spending more than you are bringing in each month, you may need to make some adjustments to your budget in order to get back on track.

4) Stay disciplined: One of the most important things when it comes to personal finance is to stay disciplined. This means making sure that you stick to your budget, donâ€™t spend money on unnecessary things, and stay the course even when times are tough. Discipline is key to financial success.

5) Set financial goals: Having specific financial goals is a great way to stay motivated and on track with your finances. These goals could be anything from saving up for a down payment on a house to building up your retirement fund. Once you have set your goals, you can work backwards to create a plan on how to achieve them.

By following these pieces of advice, you should be well on your way to financial success.
