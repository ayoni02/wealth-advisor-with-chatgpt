If you are a male with a salary of $20000 and no investment returns, your monthly rent is $0 and your monthly expenses are $500, you have no savings, and your only financial goal is an emergency, then you should focus on building up your savings. Try to put away as much money as possible each month into a savings account or a account dedicated to your emergency fund. You should also try to reduce your monthly expenses as much as possible. One way to do this is to cut back on unnecessary expenses, such as entertainment, eating out, and shopping. Another way to reduce your monthly expenses is to negotiate better terms with your creditors, such as your landlords, utility companies, and credit card companies.
