Assuming this person is employed and wants to save for a vacation, they should start by looking at their monthly expenses and see where they can cut back in order to save more money each month. One suggestion would be to cook at home more often instead of eating out, which can be a significant expense. They should also consider getting rid of any unnecessary expenses, such as subscriptions or memberships that they don't use. Once they have trimmed down their monthly expenses, they can start saving for their vacation by setting aside a certain amount each month into a savings account. They should also look into investing their money so that it can grow over time and provide them with additional funds for their vacation.
