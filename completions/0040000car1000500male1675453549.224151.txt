It is always a good idea to save up for large purchases, rather than taking on debt in the form of a loan. In this case, the best financi
al advice would be to save up for a car over a period of time, rather than buying one outright. This will help to keep the person's
monthly expenses low, and will also allow them to build up a savings cushion in case of any unexpected financial emergencies.
