There are a few things you can do to get your finances in order. One is to make sure that you are contributing to a 401k or other retirement account. This will help you save for the future and reduce your taxable income. Another thing you can do is to make sure that you are paying off any high-interest debt that you may have. This will help you save money in the long run by reducing the amount of interest you are paying. Finally, you may want to consider opening up a savings account and contributing to it on a regular basis. This will help you build up a cushion in case of emergencies or unexpected expenses.
