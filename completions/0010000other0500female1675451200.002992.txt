Assuming this person is in their early 20s, the following advice would be given:

1. Invest in yourself by contributing to a retirement account such as a 401k or IRA. Begin with at least 3-6 months of living expenses saved so that you have a cushion in case of job loss or unexpected expenses.

2. Make a budget and stick to it. Determine what your monthly expenses are and track your spending. Try to find ways to reduce your expenses so that you can save more money each month.

3. Invest your money wisely. Consider investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Work with a financial advisor to help you make investment choices that are right for your goals and risk tolerance.

4. Live below your means. Don't spend everything you make each month. Try to save at least 10% of your income so that you can build up your savings over time.

5. Make a financial plan. Set specific goals for what you want to achieve financially. This could include saving for a down payment on a house, paying off debt, or building up your retirement savings. Work with a financial advisor to create a plan that will help you reach your goals.
