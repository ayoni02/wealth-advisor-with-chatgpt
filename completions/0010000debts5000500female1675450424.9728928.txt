In order to get out of debt, the person should: 

1. Make a budget and track their spending to see where they can cut back in order to save money.

2. Try to increase their income by looking for a higher paying job or finding additional sources of income.

3. Use their savings to pay off debts, if they have any.

4. Try to get a lower interest rate on their debts by refinancing or consolidating their debts.

5. Make debt repayments a priority and focus on paying off their debts as quickly as possible.
