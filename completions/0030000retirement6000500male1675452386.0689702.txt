The first step is to make sure that your emergency fund is fully funded. This will help you cover unexpected expenses in the event that something unexpected comes up.

Once you have done that, you can start thinking about investing for your future. Retirement may seem like a long way off, but it's never too early to start saving. Try to contribute as much as you can to a retirement account. If your employer offers a matching program, be sure to take advantage of it.

In terms of your monthly expenses, see if there are any areas where you can cut back. For example, you may be able to save money on your groceries by cooking at home more often. If you are able to reduce your monthly expenses, you can use that extra money to increase your savings or invest it in another way.

Finally, keep in mind that your financial situation can change over time. Be sure to review your goals and strategies on a regular basis to make sure they are still appropriate for your situation.
