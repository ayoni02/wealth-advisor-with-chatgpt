Assuming this person would like comprehensive financial advice, here are a few pieces of advice that could be given:

1. It is important to have financial goals in mind in order to make good financial decisions. This person's goal is to save for a vacation, so she should make sure to keep that goal in mind when making any financial decisions.

2. Even though this person's salary is low, she should still make an effort to save as much money as possible. One way to do this is to create a budget and stick to it. This will help her to better track her spending and make sure that she is not spending more money than she can afford.

3. Investing is a good way to grow one's wealth over time. However, given this person's current financial situation, she may not have much money to invest. She should still make an effort to learn about investing so that she can make informed decisions when she does have money to invest.

4. This person should be careful with her credit card use. It is easy to get into debt with credit cards, so she should only use them for expenses that she knows she can afford. Additionally, she should make sure to pay off her credit card balance in full each month to avoid interest charges.

5. Finally, this person should make sure to stay informed about her finances. This means keeping up with bills, following a budget, and regularly checking her credit report. Doing so will help her to make good financial decisions and keep on track with her goals.
