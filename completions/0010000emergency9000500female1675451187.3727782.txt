If you have a regular income of $10,000 and your monthly expenses are $500, you should focus on creating an emergency fund. Try to save at least 3-6 months of living expenses so that you have a buffer in case of a job loss or unexpected expenses. Once you have a solid emergency fund, you can begin investing in other financial goals.
