If you are a man with a salary of $3,000, no returns from investment, rent of $5,000 per month, monthly expenses of $500, and no savings, you should focus on building your business. You may want to consider ways to increase your income, invest in yourself through education or training, and cut back on your expenses. You should also create a budget and make a plan to save money each month. Financial goals should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.
