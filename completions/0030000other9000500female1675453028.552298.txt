If you are a woman with a salary of $30000 and no investment returns, your rent is $9000 and your monthly expenses are $500, you have no savings, and your financial goal is something else, here is some good financial advice for you.

First, you should try to save up some money each month so that you can build up a nest egg. Even if you can only save $100 per month, over time this will add up and you will be glad you did it.

Second, you should try to invest some of your money so that you can earn a return on your investment. This can be done through stocks, mutual funds, or other investment vehicles.

Third, you should try to reduce your monthly expenses so that you can save more money each month. One way to do this is to see if you can get a cheaper apartment or house. Another way to reduce your monthly expenses is to cut back on your spending on non-essential items.

Fourth, you should create a budget so that you know where your money is going each month. This will help you to make sure that you are spending your money in a way that is helpful to your financial goals.

 Fifth, you should make a financial plan so that you know how you are going to reach your financial goals. This plan should include both short-term and long-term goals.Short-term goals could include things like saving up for a down payment on a house or investing in a solid retirement plan. Long-term goals could include things like paying off your mortgage or saving for your child's college education.

By following these five pieces of advice, you can get your finances on track and reach your financial goals.
