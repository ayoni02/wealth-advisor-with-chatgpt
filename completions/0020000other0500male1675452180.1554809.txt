Assuming this person wants good financial advice, here are a few key things they should know:

1. Save, save, save. Even if your salary isn't high, try to put away as much money as you can into savings. This will give you a cushion to fall back on in case of unexpected expenses or financial setbacks.

2. Invest your money wisely. Research different investment options and talk to a financial advisor to find out which ones make the most sense for your goals and risk tolerance.

3. Live below your means. Just because you have a certain income doesn't mean you need to spend it all. Be mindful of your spending and try to stick to a budget so that you don't end up in debt.

4. Have a financial goal in mind. Whether it's saving for retirement or something else, having a goal to work towards will help you stay on track financially.

5. Seek professional help if needed. If you're having trouble managing your finances or reaching your financial goals, don't be afraid to seek out professional help from a financial advisor or counselor.
