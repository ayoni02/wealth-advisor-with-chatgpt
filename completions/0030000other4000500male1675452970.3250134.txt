Assuming this person is living in the United States, some good financial advice for him would be to try to save up at least 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in case of emergencies, invest in a mix of stocks and bonds to get the best return on his investment, and try to pay off any high-interest debt as soon as possible. He should also try to take advantage of any employer-sponsored retirement savings plans, such as a 401(k), to get the most bang for his buck.
