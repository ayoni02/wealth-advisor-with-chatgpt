Assuming you would like a complete list of what this person should do financially, here are some tips: 

1. Review your budget and make sure you are living within your means. If your monthly expenses exceed your income, you will need to make some changes.

2. Make sure you are contributing to a retirement savings plan. If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, make sure you are contributing enough to receive the maximum employer match.

3. Invest in a diversified mix of assets, including stocks, bonds, and cash. Consider using a target date fund that automatically rebalances your investment mix as you get closer to retirement.

4. If you have debt, focus on paying it off as quickly as possible. Start with the debt with the highest interest rate and make extra payments until it is paid off.

5. Begin saving for a down payment on a home. A good rule of thumb is to save enough for a 20% down payment.

6. Stay disciplined with your finances and review your progress regularly. This will help you stay on track and make adjustments as needed.
