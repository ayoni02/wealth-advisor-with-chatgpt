There are a few things to consider when giving financial advice to someone in this situation. The first is their monthly expenses. It is important to make sure that their monthly expenses are covered by their income. If they are not, then they will need to find a way to cut back on their spending or increase their income. Another thing to consider is their financial goals. In this case, their goal is to save for their education. It is important to have a plan in place to reach this goal. This may include setting aside a certain amount of money each month to put towards their education, or investing in a 529 Plan.
