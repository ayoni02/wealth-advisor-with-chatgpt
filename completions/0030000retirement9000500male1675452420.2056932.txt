Assuming you would like tips for this person to save for retirement: 

1. Invest in a 401k: A 401k is a retirement savings plan sponsored by an employer. It offers employees tax-deferred savings and employer matching contributions. For example, if an employer offers a 3% match and an employee contributes 6% of their salary, the employer would contribute an additional 3% on top of the employee’s contribution. 

2. Invest in a Roth IRA: Roth IRA accounts are individual retirement accounts that offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, which means you’ve already paid taxes on the money you contribute. 

3. Save money automatically: One of the best ways to save money is to have it automatically transferred from your checking account into a savings account or retirement account. This way, you’ll never even see the money and you’ll be less tempted to spend it. 

4. Live below your means: One of the best things you can do for your financial future is to live below your means. This means spending less money than you make and saving the rest. Living below your means doesn’t mean you have to live a life of deprivation – it just means being mindful of your spending and making conscious choices about where you want to direct your money. 

5. Invest in yourself: One of the best investments you can make is in yourself. This includes things like getting a college degree, taking classes to improve your job skills, or investing in your health. When you invest in yourself, you’re investing in your future and your ability to earn a higher salary.
