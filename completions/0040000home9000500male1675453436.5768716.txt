There are a few things that this person could do in order to improve their financial situation. One thing that they could do is to try to save up some money each month. Even if they are only able to save a small amount, it can add up over time and help to make a dent in their overall financial goals. Another thing that they could do is to invest some of their money into something that will give them a return. This could help to offset their monthly expenses and allow them to save up more money each month. Finally, they could try to negotiate a lower rent payment with their landlord. If they are able to do this, it could save them a significant amount of money each month, which could then be used to help reach their financial goals.
