Assuming this person wants good comprehensive financial advice, here are a few things to consider: 

1. Review your current budget and make sure that your monthly expenses do not exceed your income. If they do, find ways to cut back on your spending.

2. Start saving for your future goals. If you want to start a business, start putting money away each month to help fund it.

3. Invest in yourself by taking courses or learning about financial planning and investing. The more knowledge you have, the better off you'll be.

4. Meet with a financial planner to help you map out your financial future and make sure you are on track to reach your goals.
