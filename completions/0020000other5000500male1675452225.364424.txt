Without knowing more about the person's individual financial situation, it is difficult to give comprehensive financial advice. However, some general tips could include ways to save money, such as cutting back on unnecessary expenses, or looking for ways to increase income through salary negotiation or finding side hustles. Another suggestion could be to automate savings so that a certain percentage of each paycheck is automatically deposited into a savings account. For long-term financial goals, the person could consider saving for retirement by contributing to a 401k or IRA account.
