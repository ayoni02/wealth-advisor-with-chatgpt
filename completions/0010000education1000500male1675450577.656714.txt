Assuming you would likeAdvice on how to save money: 

The person should start by looking at their expenses and see where they can cut back. Even small changes can add up over time. For example, they could cook at home more often instead of eating out, or they could carpool or take public transportation instead of driving.

They should also try to increase their income if possible. One way to do this is to ask for a raise at their job. Another way to make extra money is to start a side hustle.

Finally, the person should make sure to save for their future goals. They should set up a budget and make sure to automatically transfer a fixed percentage of their income into savings. This will help them make progress towards their goals, even if it takes some time.
