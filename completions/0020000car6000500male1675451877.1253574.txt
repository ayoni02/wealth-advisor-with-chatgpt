Assuming this person is living paycheck to paycheck, my advice would be to start by creating a budget. Begin by factoring in all monthly income and expenses, including rent, food, transportation, utilities, and debt payments. Once all monthly expenses are accounted for, this person should have a better idea of how much money they have left over each month. From there, I would advise setting aside money each month to save up for financial goals, like buying a car. This person should also consider investing in a retirement account, like a 401k or IRA, to begin building long-term wealth.
