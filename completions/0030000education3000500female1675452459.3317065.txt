The first step is to develop a budget. Track all income and expenses for at least one month to get an accurate idea of where the money is going. Once the budget is developed, try to find ways to reduce expenses.

Next, focus on building up savings. Even if it is only a small amount each month, it is important to start saving for future goals. For this person, a goal may be to save for a child's education. Try to automate savings by setting up a direct deposit from each paycheck into a savings account.

 Investing is another important part of financial planning. Even if returns are low, investing can help to grow savings over time. A financial advisor can help to develop a investment plan that meets the individual's goals.

Finally, it is important to protect the finances that have been built up. Make sure to have adequate insurance coverage in case of an unexpected event. This can help to safeguard the individual's finances and provide peace of mind.
