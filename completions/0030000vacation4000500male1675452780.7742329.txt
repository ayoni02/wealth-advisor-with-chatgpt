Based on the information given, the person's financial situation is as follows:

The person's salary is their main source of income, and they don't have any returns from investments. They are currently renting and their monthly expenses are 500. They have no savings, but their financial goal is to go on vacation.

 Advice for this person would be to start saving as much money as possible each month. They should try to put away at least 10% of their salary into savings, in order to have a cushion to cover unexpected expenses. Additionally, they should look into ways to increase their income, such as applying for a higher paying job or finding a side hustle. If they can increase their income, they should then focus on investing some of that money, in order to generate returns that can help them reach their financial goals.
