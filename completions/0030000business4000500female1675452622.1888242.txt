The first and most important piece of advice is to create and maintain a budget. This will help you to keep track of your income and expenses and make sure that your spending does not exceed your income. It is also important to save money every month, even if it is just a small amount. This will help you to build up a cushion of savings that can be used in case of an emergency or for other unexpected expenses.

Investing is also a good idea, even if the returns are not immediately high. Over time, investments can grow significantly and provide you with a financial cushion in the future.

Last but not least, it is important to have financial goals. By setting goals and working towards them, you will be more likely to stay on track financially. Having a goal to start your own business, for example, can help to motivate you to save money and make wise financial decisions.
