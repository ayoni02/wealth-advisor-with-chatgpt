Assuming this person wants good financial advice, the first step would be to figure out what his or her financial goals are. In this case, the goal is to pay off debts. The next step would be to create a budget to see where all of the person's money is going each month. This will help to see where cuts can be made in order to save money. After the budget is created, the next step would be to create a debt payoff plan. This plan should detail how much money will be put towards each debt each month. The goal is to pay off the debts as quickly as possible. Once the debt is paid off, the individual can then start to focus on saving money.
