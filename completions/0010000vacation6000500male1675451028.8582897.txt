Because this person's monthly expenses exceed their income, they will need to either increase their income or decrease their expenses. One option to increase income would be to invest in assets that will generate passive income. Another option would be to get a higher paying job. To decrease expenses, this person could look for ways to cut costs such as negotiating better terms with their landlords or finding cheaper housing. They could also try to reduce their monthly expenses by cutting back on non-essential items. One final piece of advice would be to create a budget and track their spending so that they are aware of where their money is going.
