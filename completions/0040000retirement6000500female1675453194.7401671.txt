Here are some suggestions for the person with the above financial situation:

1. Make sure you are contributing enough to your retirement savings. At your salary level, you should be saving at least 10% of your income for retirement. If you are not doing this already, start by increasing your contributions by 1-2% each year until you reach the 10% mark.

2. Consider investing in a 401(k) or other retirement savings plan that offers employer matching contributions. This can be an excellent way to boost your retirement savings.

3. Make sure you are taking advantage of all available tax breaks. This may include contributing to a health savings account (HSA) if you have a high-deductible health insurance plan, or contributing to a flexible spending account (FSA) for eligible health and child care expenses.

4. Review your expenses and see if there are any areas where you can cut back, even by a small amount. Every little bit you can save will help you reach your financial goals.

5. Make sure you have an adequate emergency fund. This should be enough money to cover your living expenses for at least 3-6 months. If you do not have an emergency fund, start by saving $1,000 and then build up from there.

6. Develop a financial plan. This can help you stay on track with your financial goals and make sure you are taking the right steps to achieve them. A financial planner can help you develop a comprehensive financial plan.
