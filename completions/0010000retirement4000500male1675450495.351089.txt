Start by contributing to a retirement account such as a 401k or IRA. You should contribute enough to get the full employer match, if offered. If not, contribute 10-15% of your salary.

Next, focus on building up an emergency fund. This should be 3-6 months of living expenses. Once you have saved up this much, you can start investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.

Finally, make sure you are staying on top of your monthly expenses. Try to cut back on unnecessary expenses and put the extra money towards your financial goals.
