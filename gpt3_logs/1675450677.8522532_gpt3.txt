The most important thing for this person to do is to develop a budget and stick to it. This will help her to see where her money is going and make adjustments as necessary. She should also work on building up her savings so that she has a cushion to fall back on in case of an emergency. One way to do this is to set aside a fixed amount of money from each paycheck into savings. Finally, she should develop a plan for reaching her financial goals. This may include investing in a diversified mix of stocks and bonds, and saving regularly.
