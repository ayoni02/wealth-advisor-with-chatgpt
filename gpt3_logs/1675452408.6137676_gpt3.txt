give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming you would like advice for the financial situation given: 

First, this person should make sure that they are putting away enough money each month into savings. It is always a good idea to have at least 3-6 months of living expenses saved in case of an emergency. Once they have built up their savings, they can start thinking about investing some of that money. Since this person's goal is retirement, they should look into investments that will give them a good return over a long period of time. They could consider investing in a mix of stocks and bonds, which will offer both potential growth and stability. Additionally, they should make sure to keep track of their expenses each month and try to cut back where possible in order to boost their savings.
