==========

Start by evaluating your current financial situation and coming up with a budget. Make sure you are taking advantage of any employer matches when it comes to contributing to a retirement account. If you are not, start there. Then, focus on building up your emergency fund so that you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved. Once you have that cushion, you can start investing in a diversified mix of stocks and bonds. Consider using a financial advisor to help you with this if you are not comfortable managing your investments yourself. Lastly, make sure you have a solid estate plan in place. This includes a will, powers of attorney, and health care directive. By taking these steps, you will be on your way to a solid financial future.
