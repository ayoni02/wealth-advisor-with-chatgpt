==========

Assuming you would like personal financial advice for the person with the given financial situation: 

Firstly, this person should create a budget in order to get a clear idea of their monthly income and expenses. Once they have done this, they should try to cut down on their expenses where possible in order to save money. For example, they could cook at home rather than eating out, or shop around for cheaper utility providers. 

Secondly, this person should try to make additional income by finding ways to increase their salary or by earning money through side hustles or investments. For example, they could ask for a raise at work, start freelancing, or invest in a stocks and shares ISA. 

Thirdly, this person should create financial goals and make a plan on how to achieve them. For example, if their goal is to save for a house deposit, they should calculate how much they need to save each month in order to reach their target. They could also set up a regular savings account which automatically transfers a set amount of money into savings each month. 

Fourthly, this person should make sure that they have adequate insurance cover in case of an unexpected event. For example, they could take out health, life, and home insurance. 

Fifthly, this person should learn about different financial products and services in order to make the most of their money. For example, they could research the best interest rates for savings accounts and compare different credit cards to find one with the lowest interest rate. 

Finally, this person should keep track of their progress and review their finances regularly. This will help them to stay on track with their goals and make any necessary changes to their budget or saving plan.
