imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 30000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 5000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = education

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Ideally, the person in this situation should be saving around 10% of their salary each month, which would amount to $300. This could be deposited into a savings account, used to pay down debt, or invested in a longer-term goal such as education. The individual in this situation should also be sure to have an emergency fund that can cover at least 3-6 months of living expenses, in case of a job loss or unexpected expenses.
