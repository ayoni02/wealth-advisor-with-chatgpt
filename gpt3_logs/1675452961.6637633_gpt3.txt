imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 30000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 3000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = other

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming this person wants financial advice: 

For a young person in their 20s or 30s, I would say that it is very important to start saving for retirement as soon as possible. Even if you are not making a lot of money, you can still put away a little each month into a retirement account. I would also advise this person to start investing their money into something that will give them a return. For example, they could start investing in a mutual fund or stocks. They should also try to make sure that their rent/month is no more than 30% of their salary. This will allow them to save more money each month.
