==========

Assuming you would like advice on how to save for a car: 

Create a budget: 

First, calculate your after-tax income by taking your salary and subtracting any taxes you owe. Then, subtract your monthly expenses from your after-tax income. This will give you your disposable income. 

Next, you need to figure out how much you need to save each month to reach your goal. Let’s say a mid-size car costs $20,000. If you want to buy the car in three years, you will need to save $555 per month. 

To figure out how much you need to save each month, you can use this formula: 

Car cost - Down payment = Loan amount

Loan amount / 36 (months) = Monthly payment

Monthly payment + Monthly insurance + Monthly gas = Total monthly car expenses 

Total monthly car expenses - Disposable income = Monthly savings needed

Create a savings plan: 

Save your money in a high yield savings account so you can earn interest on your balance. Open a new account specifically for your car fund so you aren’t tempted to spend the money on something else. 

Automate your savings: 

Set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your savings account so you don’t have to think about it. This way, you’ll be less likely to miss a payment or use the money for something else.

Cut back on expenses: 

Look at your budget and see if there are any areas where you can cut back on your spending. For example, you might be able to save money by cooking at home more often or cutting back on your cable TV package. 

Find extra sources of income: 

Consider ways to bring in extra money so you can reach your savings goal more quickly. For example, you might want to get a part-time job or start a side hustle.
