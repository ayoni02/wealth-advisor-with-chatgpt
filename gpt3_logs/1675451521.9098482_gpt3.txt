savings = 0
financial goals = education

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

The individual's financial situation is quite dire, with little savings and little to no income from investments. The best course of action would be to immediately start looking for ways to increase their salary and to also look for ways to reduce their monthly expenses. One way to achieve this could be to find a cheaper place to live, or to negotiate with their current landlord for a lower rent. Another way to reduce expenses could be to cut back on unnecessary spending, such as eating out or buying new clothes.

In terms of financial goals, it is important to set short-term and long-term goals. For the individual in question, a short-term goal could be to save up for a rainy day fund, which could be used in case of an emergency. A long-term goal could be to save up for their children's education.

It is also important to invest money wisely. One way to do this could be to invest in a mutual fund, which is a pool of money that is invested in a variety of different securities. Another way to invest money could be to buy individual stocks or bonds.
