There are a few things that this person could do in order to improve their financial situation. One option would be to invest their money in a business. This could help them to make a return on their investment, and potentially make a profit. Another option would be to save their money each month. This could help them to build up a savings account that they could use in the future for emergencies or other unforeseen expenses. Finally, this person could try to reduce their monthly expenses by cutting back on unnecessary spending. This could free up more money to save or invest each month, and help to improve their overall financial situation.
