First, the person should save up at least 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in an emergency fund. This will help cover unexpected costs in case of job loss or other unexpected financial hardships.

Next, the person should focus on building up their investment portfolio. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments can provide stability and growth over time.

Finally, the person should create a budget and stick to it. This will help them keep track of their monthly expenses and make sure they are not overspending.
