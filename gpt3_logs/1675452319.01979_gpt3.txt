imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 30000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 7000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = debts

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Some good financial advice for this person would be to try and save up some money each month so that they can put it towards their debts. It is also important to try and reduce their monthly expenses as much as possible so that they can free up some more money to put towards their debt repayment. One way to do this could be to get rid of any unnecessary expenses and to try and negotiate lower rates on things like their rent. Additionally, this person should try to make some additional money through investments or other means so that they can more quickly pay off their debts.
