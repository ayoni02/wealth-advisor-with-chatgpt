rent/month = 0
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = retirement

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming this person is younger than retirement age, the most important financial goal should be saving for retirement. The best way to do this is to start contributing to a retirement account as soon as possible, such as a 401k or Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Even if you can only afford to contribute a small amount each month, it will add up over time.

In addition to saving for retirement, it is also important to have an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses. This should be a separate account from your retirement savings and you should only use it for true emergencies. Try to contribute to your emergency fund each month so that it will grow over time.

Finally, it is important to live within your means and not spend more money than you earn. This may mean making some lifestyle changes, such as eating out less or buying fewer clothes. Review your monthly expenses and see where you can cut back in order to save more money each month.
