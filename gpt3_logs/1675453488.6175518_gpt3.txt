sex = female
salary = 40000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 4000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = business

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Firstly, the person should try to put aside some money each month into savings, even if it is a small amount. It is important to have a financial cushion to fall back on in case of an emergency. The person should also try to invest some of their money, in order to get better returns in the future.

The person should also try to reduce their monthly expenses, by cutting back on unnecessary spending and living a more frugal lifestyle. This will free up more money to save and invest.

Finally, the person should have specific financial goals in mind, such as starting a business. They should make a plan and budget to reach these goals. With proper financial planning, the person will be able to achieve their goals and improve their financial situation.
