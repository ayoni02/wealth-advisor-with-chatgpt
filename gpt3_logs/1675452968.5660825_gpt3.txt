==========

There are a few things that this person could do in order to improve their financial situation. Firstly, they could try to increase their income by looking for a higher paying job or negotiating a raise at their current job. Secondly, they could try to reduce their monthly expenses by cutting back on unnecessary expenditure and/or finding ways to reduce their rent/mortgage payments. Finally, they could try to increase their savings by setting aside a fixed amount of money each month into a savings account.

In terms of financial goals, it is important to first of all identify what these goals are. Once these goals have been identified, the person can then start to work towards achieving them. For example, if the goal is to buy a house, the person could start saving up for a down payment and/or look into getting a mortgage. If the goal is to retire early, the person could start contributing to a retirement savings account.
