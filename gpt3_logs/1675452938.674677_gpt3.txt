Assuming this person is not married: 

1. Make a budget: Determine how much you need to cover your essential expenses every month and how much you can afford to save. Make sure to include a buffer in your budget for unexpected expenses. Then track your spending to make sure you are staying on track.

2. Invest in yourself: One of the best investments you can make is in yourself. If you are not earning enough to cover your costs, look for ways to increase your income. Invest in your education and job skills to make yourself more marketable and earn a higher salary.

3. Save: Even if you can only afford to save a small amount each month, start doing it. Automate your savings so that it is taken out of your account before you have a chance to spend it. Invest your savings in a high-yield savings account or a short-term bond fund to earn more on your money.

4. Get rid of debt: High-interest debt is a drag on your finances. If you can, pay off your debt as quickly as possible. If you can't afford to pay it off all at once, consider a debt consolidation loan to get a lower interest rate and lower your monthly payments.

5. Create a retirement plan: It's never too early to start thinking about retirement. Figure out how much you will need to have saved to cover your costs in retirement. Then start saving and investing for retirement. Consider taking advantage of a 401(k) or IRA to get tax breaks on your savings.
