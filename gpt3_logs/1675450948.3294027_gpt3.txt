give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming you would like advice on saving and reaching the goal of owning a car, here are a few ideas: 

1. Invest in a high yield savings account or a short-term CD. Both of these options offer relatively low-risk returns, which can help you reach your savings goals more quickly.

2. Consider saving at least 10% of your income each month. This may require making some adjustments to your budget, but it will be worth it in the long run.

3. Make a budget and stick to it. This will help you stay on track with your spending and ensure that you are putting enough money away each month to reach your financial goals.

4. Invest in yourself. Consider taking a financial course or reading personal finance books to better understand how to manage your money. This knowledge will help you make better decisions with your money and reach your goals more quickly.
