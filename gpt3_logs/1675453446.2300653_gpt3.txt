Assuming you would like comprehensive financial advice for a woman with the following situation: 

A woman making $40,000 a year, has no monthly rent or investment returns, and has $500 in monthly expenses. She has no savings and would like to start a business. 

Here is some comprehensive financial advice for this woman: 

1. Try to increase your income by finding ways to make more money. This could include asking for a raise, looking for a higher paying job, or starting your own business. 

2. Try to reduce your monthly expenses by cutting back on unnecessary spending and creating a budget. 

3. Try to save as much money as possible each month so you can eventually start your own business. One way to do this is to set up a budget and automatically transfer a fixed amount of money into your savings account each month. 

4. Once you have saved up enough money, you can start your own business. Before starting your business, be sure to do your research and create a detailed business plan.
