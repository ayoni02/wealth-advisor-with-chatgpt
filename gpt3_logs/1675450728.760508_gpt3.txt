imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 10000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 7000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = home

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Some good financial advice for this individual would be to try and save up as much money as possible each month in order to reach their goal of owning a home. This could be done by setting up a budget and sticking to it as closely as possible. Additionally, this person may want to consider investing in some form of real estate so that they can potentially make money off of their investment in the future.
