give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming this person wants comprehensive financial advice, here are a few key things to keep in mind:

1. Make sure to have an emergency fund that can cover at least 3-6 months of living expenses. This will help you weather any financial difficulties that may come up.

2. Invest in a diversified mix of assets, including stocks, bonds, and cash. This will help you protect your savings and grow your wealth over time.

3. Try to keep your monthly expenses low, so that you can save more money each month. There are a number of ways to do this, such as cooking at home, cutting back on unnecessary expenses, and living in a more affordable location.

4. Have a clear plan for your financial goals. Retirement may be your main goal, but make sure to consider other factors as well, such as saving for a down payment on a house or taking care of loved ones.

5. Seek professional help if you need it. A financial advisor can help you create a personalized plan that takes into account your unique circumstances.
