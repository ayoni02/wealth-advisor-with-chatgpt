Assuming you would like tips for the person with this financial situation: 

Save, save, save! Try to have 3-6 months of living expenses saved so that you have a cushion in case of tough times or job loss. Track your spending and see where you can cut back, even by a little bit, so that you can max out your savings. Once you have a solid savings, you can start thinking about investing. 

Think about your financial goals and what you need to do to achieve them. Buying a home may require a larger down payment than you have saved, so you may need to rethink your timeline. Or, you may need to get creative with your financing. There are a number of creative financing options available, such as house hacking (living in part of a multifamily property and renting out the other units) to help you save for a down payment. 

Build up your credit score so that you can qualify for the best mortgage terms possible. This may require paying down any debt that you have and being mindful of your credit utilization. 

Meet with a financial advisor to get tailored advice for your specific situation.
