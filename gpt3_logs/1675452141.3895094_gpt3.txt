give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming this person is living in the United States, the first thing I would recommend is creating a budget. This will help to get a clear picture of where all of their money is going each month. Once they have a budget in place, they can start working on ways to reduce their monthly expenses. I would also recommend that they start saving at least 10% of their income each month. This can be done by setting up a direct deposit from their paycheck into a savings account. Lastly, I would recommend that they invest in a good emergency fund. This should be a savings account with 3-6 months of living expenses in it. This will help to cover any unexpected costs that may come up.
