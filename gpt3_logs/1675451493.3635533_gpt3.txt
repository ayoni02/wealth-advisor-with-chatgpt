imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 20000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 7000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = retirement

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming this person wants to retire at 65: 

If saving for retirement is the goal, the first step is to calculate how much money will be needed. This can be done by estimating how much money will be needed per year in retirement, and then multiplying that number by the number of years until retirement. 

For example, if this person expects to need $30,000 per year in retirement and plans to retire in 30 years, she will need a retirement nest egg of $900,000. 

To reach this goal, she will need to save $33,333 per year, or approximately $2,780 per month. This can be accomplished by contributing the maximum amount to a 401(k) or IRA, and then investing the rest in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. 

In addition to saving for retirement, this person should also focus on building up an emergency fund. This fund should be large enough to cover six months of living expenses in the event that she loses her job or faces another unexpected financial setback. 

Lastly, she should make sure she is taking full advantage of any employer benefits, such as a 401(k) match. If her employer offers a 401(k) match, she should be contributing at least enough to her 401(k) to get the full match.
