imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 10000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 7000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = education

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

The best financial advice for this person would be to focus on saving for their future educational goals. This can be done by setting up a budget and sticking to it in order to allow for extra money to be put towards savings each month. Another suggestion would be to look into ways to increase their income, such as getting a higher paying job or finding additional sources of income. Additionally, this person should be mindful of their expenses and try to cut back where possible in order to have more money to put towards savings.
