imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 30000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 9000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = home

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Some good financial advice for a person in this situation may be to invest in a property rather than rent, as this will provide them with long-term security and the potential for growth. They should also try to reduce their monthly expenses by, for example, cutting back on unnecessary luxuries or renegotiating their rent. It is also important to build up savings so that they have a cushion to fall back on in case of emergencies. Lastly, they should develop a financial plan that outlines their goals and how they intend to achieve them.
