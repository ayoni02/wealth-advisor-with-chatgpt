imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 30000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 9000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = debts

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

The best financial advice for this person would be to focus on paying off their debts as quickly as possible. This will help to free up more of their monthly income to save and invest for the future. To do this, they could focus on paying down the debts with the highest interest rates first. Additionally, they should try to cut back on their monthly expenses as much as possible to free up more money to put towards their debts. Finally, they should consider consulting with a financial advisor to help them create a more comprehensive financial plan.
