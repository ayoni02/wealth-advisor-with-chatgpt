give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming you would like advice for the person with the given financial situation, here are a few recommendations:

1. Invest in yourself by taking courses or attending seminars to learn more about investing. The more you know about investing, the better your chances are of seeing returns from your investment.

2. Make saving a priority. Create a budget and make sure to include savings in it. Try to save at least 10% of your income each month. If you can, try to automate your savings so that it is taken out of your account before you even have a chance to spend it.

3. Consider your financial goals. In this case, the goal is education. Make sure to include this in your budget and save accordingly. One way to do this is to set up a dedicated savings account for your education expenses.

4. Review your expenses and see where you can cut back. For example, if you are eating out often, try cooking at home more. If you have expensive monthly subscriptions, see if you can cancel them or switch to a cheaper option.

5. Make a plan. Write down your goals, both short-term and long-term. Make a budget and stick to it. Review your progress regularly and make adjustments as needed.
