imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 30000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 8000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = debts

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Some good financial advice for this person would be to first focus on paying off any debts that they may have. Once they are debt-free, they can begin to save up money each month and invest it in a way that will generate returns. Additionally, this person should try to reduce their monthly expenses as much as possible in order to increase their savings.
