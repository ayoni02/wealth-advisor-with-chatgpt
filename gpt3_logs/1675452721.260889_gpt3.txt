returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 6000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = car

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

The advice for this person would be to first save up for a down payment on a car. They should look into investing their money into a higher yielding investment, such as a mutual fund, to help reach their financial goals quicker. They should also try to reduce their monthly expenses by cutting back on unnecessary spending.
