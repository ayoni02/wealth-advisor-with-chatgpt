==========

If you are a woman with a salary of $30000, no investment returns, renting for $1000 a month, and monthly expenses of $500, you may want to focus on financial goals such as paying down debts. One option to consider is finding a less expensive place to live in order to save more money each month. Another option could be to get a roommate to help with expenses. You could also look for ways to increase your income, such as asking for a raise or taking on a side hustle. Whatever route you decide to take, make sure you create a budget and stick to it so that you can reach your financial goals.
