If you are a woman with a salary of $10,000 and no investment returns, but you have rental income of $4,000 per month and monthly expenses of $500, you may want to consider using your saved money to purchase a car. You may also want to consider saving up for a down payment on a house or investing in a solid stock portfolio that can provide you with long-term financial stability.
