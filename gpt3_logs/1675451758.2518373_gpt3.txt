savings = 0
financial goals = business

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

The most important thing for this person to do is to create a budget and stick to it. This will help him get a better understanding of his financial situation and find areas where he can cut back on expenses. He should also try to save as much as possible, even if it is just a few hundred dollars each month.

Another important step for this person is to start investing. Even if he isnâ€™t making much in returns, it is important to start building up a portfolio now so that he can reap the benefits later down the road. He should also think about his long-term financial goals and how best to achieve them. For example, if he wants to start his own business, he should start saving now so that he has the capital to do so in the future.
