imagine a person with the following financial situation;

monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = home

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming this person's goal is to purchase a home, the following are some pieces of financial advice that could be given:

1. Save as much as possible each month: Even if it is just $50-$100, every bit saved will help towards the down payment on a home. Try to have at least 3-6 months of living expenses saved so that unexpected costs don't derail home purchasing plans.

2. Invest money: Even if returns are small, over time compounding can help grow savings. Also, some investments (such as real estate) can appreciate in value, providing another source of funds for a down payment.

3. Consider other financing options: In addition to a traditional mortgage, there are other ways to finance a home purchase, such as through a home equity loan or line of credit. Talk to a financial advisor to see what makes the most sense for your situation.

4. Make a budget: Track all income and expenses so that you have a clear idea of where your money is going each month. This will help whip your finances into shape and free up more money to save for a home.

5. Get creative: There are many ways to save money on housing costs, such as house hacking (purchasing a property with additional units and renting them out) or looking for cheaper alternatives to traditional purchasing, such as through a land contract or lease-to-own agreement.
