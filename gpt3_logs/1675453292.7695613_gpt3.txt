There are a few things that this person could do in order to improve their financial situation. Firstly, they could invest some of their money into a higher-yielding investment, such as stocks or mutual funds. This would help them to grow their savings more quickly. Additionally, they could try to negotiate a lower rent payment with their landlord. Finally, they could cut back on their monthly expenses by eliminating unnecessary expenses and/or finding cheaper alternatives for necessary expenses.
