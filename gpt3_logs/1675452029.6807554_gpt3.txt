give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming this person is the only earner in the household, the first step would be to create a budget. This will help to get a clear understanding of where all of the money is going each month. The budget should factor in all mandatory expenses (rent, utilities, food, etc.), as well as any debts that need to be paid off. Once all essential expenses are accounted for, the individual can then start to think about saving for their financial goal.

Ideally, the person would try to save at least 10% of their income each month. If they are unable to do this, they can start with a smaller percentage and gradually increase it over time. One way to make saving easier is to set up a direct deposit from the person's paycheck into a savings account. This way, they are less likely to be tempted to spend the money.

Another financial goal that this person should consider is building up an emergency fund. This will help to cover unexpected expenses in the future, such as a car repair or medical bills. A good rule of thumb is to save enough to cover 3-6 months of living expenses. Once again, setting up a direct deposit into a dedicated savings account can be helpful.

Once the person has a good handle on their monthly budget and has started saving for their financial goals, they can then begin to think about investing. Since they have a limited amount of money to work with, they may want to consider investing in a low-risk option, such as a savings account or a CD. over time, as the person's financial situation improves, they can begin to take on more risk by investing in stocks or mutual funds.
