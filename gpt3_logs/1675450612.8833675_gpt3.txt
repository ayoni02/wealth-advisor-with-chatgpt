==========

Assuming this person's primary financial goal is to save for education, there are a few key pieces of advice that can be given in order to help them achieve this goal.

1. Review your expenses and see where you can cut back. Saving even a small amount each month can add up over time and make it easier to reach your goals.

2. Consider setting up a separate savings account for your education funds. This will help you keep track of your progress and make it less likely that you'll dip into the account for non-educational expenses.

3. Invest your money wisely. Research different investment options and speak with a financial advisor to get started.

4. Make extra payments on any debt you may have. This will free up more money each month to put towards savings.

By following these tips, you can make significant progress towards your goal of saving for education.
