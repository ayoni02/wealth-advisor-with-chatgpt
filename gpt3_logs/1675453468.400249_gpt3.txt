give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming this person would like comprehensive financial advice, here are a few suggestions: 

1. First, create a budget and track all spending. This will help to get a clear picture of where money is being spent and where cuts can be made, if necessary.

2. Next, focus on building up an emergency fund. This will help to cover unexpected costs in the future and will give peace of mind knowing that there is a cushion in case of tough times.

3. Invest money wisely. Consider return on investment (ROI) and don't be afraid to ask for help from a financial advisor if needed.

4. Make financial goals and stick to them. Whether it's saving for a down payment on a house or investing in a business, having specific goals will help to keep on track.

5. Finally, stay disciplined with spending and saving. Review the budget regularly and make necessary changes as life circumstances change. Also, don't be afraid to splurge on occasion- just be sure that it fits into the budget!
