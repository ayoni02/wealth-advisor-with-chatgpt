==========

Assuming this person is working towards a financial goal of starting a business, the following is some advice that could be given in order to help save money.

Try to increase your income if possible, whether through raises or finding a higher paying job. If you are able to bring in more money each month, you can put more towards your savings and reaching your financial goals.

Try to reduce your monthly expenses as much as possible. Cutting back on things like nights out, subscriptions, and other extraneous costs can help you save money each month.

Try to put as much money as possible into savings each month. Even if it is only a small amount, over time it can add up. Having a solid savings can help you reach your financial goals quicker and provide a safety net in case of unexpected costs.
