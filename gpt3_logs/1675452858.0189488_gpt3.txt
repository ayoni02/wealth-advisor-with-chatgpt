give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming that this person would like some comprehensive financial advice, here are a few things that could be recommended.

First and foremost, it is always advisable to have some sort of emergency fund set aside in case of unexpected expenses. This could be done by setting aside a certain amount of money from each paycheck into a savings account. The amount that is saved will depend on the individual's financial situation and goals, but a good rule of thumb is to save 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

Another recommendation would be to invest some money into a retirement account, such as a 401(k) or IRA. The sooner this is done, the better, as retirement savings tend to compound over time. The amount that is invested will again depend on the individual's financial situation and goals, but a good general rule is to invest 10-15% of one's income into a retirement account.

Finally, it is always advisable to try to live within one's means and avoid excessive debt. This means spending less than one earns and only taking on debt that is absolutely necessary. If possible, it is also a good idea to try to pay off any existing debt, such as credit card balances or student loans, as soon as possible.
