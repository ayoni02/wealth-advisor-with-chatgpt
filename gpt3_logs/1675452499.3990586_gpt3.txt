imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 30000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 9000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = education

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

The first place to start is by looking at your goals. In this case, you want to focus on saving for education. Try to break down how much you will need to save each month in order to reach your goal. For example, if you want to save $10,000 for education in two years, you would need to save $416.67 per month.

Next, you need to look at your income and figure out how much you can afford to save each month. In this case, you make $3,000 per month and have $9,000 in rent/monthly expenses. This leaves you with $1,500 left over each month. After subtracting your goal of $416.67 per month, you have $1,083.33 left to work with.

Now you need to start thinking about how to invest that money. One option is to look into returns from investments. This can be a riskier option, but if done correctly, can give you a higher return. Another option is to simply save the money into a savings account. This may not make you as much money in the long run, but it is a safer option.

Either way, you need to be smart about how you handle your money. Make sure to create a budget and stick to it. This will help you stay on track and reach your financial goals.
