Assuming this person wants to start a business: 

1. The first step is to create a business plan. This will help you determine the amount of money you need to start your business and how much you need to realistically make to sustain yourself.

2. Next, you need to figure out how to finance your business. If you have savings, you can use that to start your business. However, you may need to take out a loan or bring on investors.

3. Once you have the finances sorted out, you need to start building your business. This includes finding customers, developing your product or service, and marketing your business.

4. Finally, you need to keep track of your progress and adjust your plans as needed. This includes tracking your expenses, revenue, and goals. It is also important to regularly review your business plan to make sure you are on track.
