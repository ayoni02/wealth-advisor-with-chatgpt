==========

First, you need to save at least 3-6 months of living expenses in an emergency fund. This will help you cover unexpected expenses in the event that you lose your job or have a major unexpected expense.

Next, you need to start contributing to a retirement account. If your employer offers a 401k plan, you should contribute enough to receive the employer match. If not, you should open an IRA and contribute as much as you can afford.

 After you have an emergency fund and are contributing to retirement, you should start working on paying off your rent/month. The sooner you can become rent/month free, the more money you will have to save and invest.

Lastly, you need to be mindful of your monthly expenses. Make sure you are not spending more than you are bringing in each month. If you can live on a budget and keep your expenses low, you will be in good financial shape.
