The most important thing for this person to do is to start saving as soon as possible. Even if it is only a small amount, it is important to start building up a savings cushion. Additionally, this person should focus on paying off any debts that they may have as this will free up more money to save each month.

As for investments, there are a few different options that this person could explore. One option would be to invest in a mutual fund or index fund, which can provide a moderate return over time. Another option would be to invest in real estate, which has the potential to provide a higher return but also comes with a higher level of risk. Ultimately, the best investment strategy for this person will depend on their risk tolerance and financial goals.

In terms of the person's financial goals, it is important to create a realistic plan. For example, if the goal is to purchase a home, the person should consider how much they will need to save for a down payment and how long it will take to reach this goal. Additionally, it is important to create a budget and stick to it in order to ensure that all of the person's financial goals are achievable.
