==========

.

There are a few things to consider when giving financial advice to someone in this situation. First, if the person has a steady income and does not have any outstanding debts, it is important to save money each month in order to reach her financial goals. It is also important to invest money in order to grow her savings. However, since the person's income is relatively low, she should be careful not to over-invest and put her financial stability at risk. Another important factor to consider is the person's monthly expenses. If the person is spending more than she is earning, it is important to cut back on expenses in order to save money. Finally, it is also important to create a budget and track her spending in order to stay on track with her financial goals.
