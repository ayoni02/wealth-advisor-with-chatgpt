If you are a male with a salary of $30000 and no investment returns, rent of $4000 monthly, and expenses of $500 monthly, your goal should be to pay off your debts. You can do this by creating a budget and sticking to it. Try to find ways to reduce your expenses and/or increase your income. You may also want to consider debt consolidation or credit counseling.
