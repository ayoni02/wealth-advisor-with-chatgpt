imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 20000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 1000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = business

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

If you are a woman with a salary of $20,000, you should try to invest in a business. You may not be able to get returns from your investment right away, but over time, you could make a lot of money from your business. You should also try to save up some money each month so that you can eventually buy a house or an apartment.
