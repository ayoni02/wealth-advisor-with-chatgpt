imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 10000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 0
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = debts

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming this person has no debt, the best financial advice would be to start saving as much money as possible. This can be done by setting up a budget and sticking to it. The goal should be to save at least 10% of your monthly income. Once you have saved up enough money, you can start investing it in a diversified portfolio of assets. This will help you achieve your financial goals and grow your wealth over time.
