imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 30000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 7000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = debts

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Some basic financial advice for someone in this situation would be to focus on paying off their debts as quickly as possible. This may involve making some sacrifices in terms of their monthly expenses in order to put more towards their debts each month. They may also want to consider finding ways to increase their income, whether through getting a higher paying job or finding other sources of income such as investments. Once their debts are paid off, they can then focus on saving up for their other financial goals.
