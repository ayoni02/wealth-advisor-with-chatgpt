==========

This person's financial situation is not so great. The first thing this person should do is to try and increase their salary. They could do this by looking for a new job or by asking for a raise at their current job. Another way to increase their salary is to invest in themselves by getting additional education or training.

This person should also try to reduce their monthly expenses by cutting back on unnecessary expenses and by looking for ways to save money on their regular expenses. One way to do this is to cook at home more often instead of eating out. Another way to save money is to purchase items on sale or to buy used items instead of new items.

This person should also try to increase their savings by setting aside money each month to put into savings. They should also try to invest their money wisely so that they can earn additional income from their investments. One way to do this is to put their money into a high-yielding savings account or a short-term investment such as a CD.

This person's financial goals should be to increase their salary, reduce their monthly expenses, and increase their savings. By doing these things, this person will be on their way to financial success.
