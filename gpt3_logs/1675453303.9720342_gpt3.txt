imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 40000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 7000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = education

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

One of the best things this person can do is to save up for their financial goal of education. One of the best ways to do this is to get a job that offers a good salary and benefits package. Another way to save for education is to invest in a 529 plan. This will allow the person to save for their education and get tax breaks on their investment.
