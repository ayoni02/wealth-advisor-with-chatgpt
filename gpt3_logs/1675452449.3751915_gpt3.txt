sex = male
salary = 30000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 2000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = education

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

The person should start by looking at their financial goals and figuring out how much money they will need to save in order to reach those goals. They should also create a budget in order to see where their money is going every month and where they can cut back on expenses. It may be a good idea for the person to invest their money in order to try and grow their savings. Education is a good financial goal, and the person should make sure that they are doing everything they can to save for it.
