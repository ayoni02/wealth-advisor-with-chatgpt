give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Some good financial advice for a person in this situation would be to save up enough money to cover at least six months of living expenses, in case of job loss or other unforeseen circumstance. Additionally, this person should contribute as much as possible to a retirement savings account, such as a 401(k) or IRA, to ensure a comfortable retirement. This person should also try to pay down their debts, starting with the debt with the highest interest rate. Finally, this person should develop a budget and stick to it in order to stay on track with their financial goals.
