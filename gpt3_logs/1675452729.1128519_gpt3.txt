give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Here are a few tips that may help this person get on track financially:

1. Start by looking at your monthly expenses and make sure that you are only spending money on things that are absolutely necessary. For example, if you are spending $500 on entertainment every month, see if you can cut that back to $250 or even $100.

2. Make sure you are contributing to a retirement account such as a 401k or IRA. Even if your company does not offer a retirement plan, you can still open an IRA on your own.

3. Make a budget and stick to it. Track your spending using a personal finance app or excel spreadsheet so that you are aware of where your money is going.

4. Have a financial goal in mind, whether it is saving for a down payment on a house or simply having a cushion of cash in case of an emergency. Having a goal will help you stay focused and motivated.

5. Invest your money wisely. Research different investment options and speak with a financial advisor to find out what would be best for your situation.

By following these tips, you can get your finances on track and achieve your financial goals.
