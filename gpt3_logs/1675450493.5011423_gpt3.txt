==========

Assuming that this person is relatively young, a good first step would be to begin contributing to a retirement account, such as a 401k or IRA. The sooner this person begins saving for retirement, the better off they will be. Another step would be to begin investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks and mutual funds. Over time, this will help to grow their savings and give them a nest egg to draw upon in retirement. Additionally, this person should focus on building up an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses. This can be done by setting aside a certain amount of money each month into a savings account. Finally, it is important to be mindful of monthly expenses and try to keep them to a minimum. Cutting back on unnecessary spending can free up more money to save and invest for the future.
