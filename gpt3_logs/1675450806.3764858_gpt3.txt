==========

Assuming you would like personal financial advice for the person with the given financial situation, here are a few suggestions: 

-Start by creating a budget to get a clear understanding of where all of their money is going each month. This will help to identify any areas where money is being unnecessarily spent so that it can be reallocated to other areas or goals.

-Try to increase their income by looking for ways to either earn more money or reduce their monthly expenses. Even a small increase in income can make a big difference in the long run.

-Save as much money as possible each month. Even if it is only a small amount, it will add up over time. Having a savings cushion will help to cushion the blow of any unexpected expenses that may come up.

-Invest money into a retirement fund as early as possible. This will allow them to take advantage of compound interest and have a larger sum of money saved up by the time they retire.

-If they have any debt, try to pay it off as quickly as possible. This will save them money on interest payments in the long run.

-Business goals may require additional financial planning and advice from a professional. However, some basic advice would be to save as much money as possible to start up the business and to have a clear understanding of all associated costs.
