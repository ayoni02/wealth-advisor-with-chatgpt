give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Your financial advice to this person would be to save as much money as possible each month in order to reach their financial goal of buying a home. One way to do this would be to create a budget and track their expenses so that they are aware of where their money is going. Another way to save money would be to invest in a high yield savings account or a certificate of deposit so that they can earn interest on their savings. Finally, this person should make sure that they are taking advantage of any employer matching programs for retirement savings so that they can save for the future.
