There are a few things that this person could do in order to improve their financial situation. One option would be to try to increase their income by finding a job that pays more or by getting a promotion at their current job. Another option would be to try to reduce their monthly expenses by cutting back on unnecessary expenses or looking for ways to save money on their regular bills. Another option would be to try to increase their savings by setting aside money each month to put into a savings account or investing in a long-term savings plan. Finally, this person could try to pay off their debts by making extra payments on their debts each month or by consolidating their debts into one loan with a lower interest rate.
