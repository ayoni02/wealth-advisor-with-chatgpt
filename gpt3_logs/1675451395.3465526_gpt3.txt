imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 20000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 7000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = debts

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming that the person wants good comprehensive financial advice, the following advice can be given:

First, the person should try to increase their salary if possible. If they are unable to do so, they should try to increase their returns from investment. Additionally, the person should try to reduce their monthly expenses, and increase their savings if possible.

In terms of specific financial goals, the person should focus on paying off their debts as soon as possible. Once they have done so, they can then focus on other financial goals, such as saving for retirement or investing in a property.
