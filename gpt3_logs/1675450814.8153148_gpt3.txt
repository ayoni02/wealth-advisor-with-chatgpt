First, you should take a look at your long-term financial goals. If you plan to start a business, you will need to save money in order to afford the startup costs. You should also make sure that you have enough money saved up to cover your living expenses for a period of time in case your business doesn't immediately take off.

In terms of investments, you should conservative with your approach since you have a limited amount of money to work with. You may want to consider investing in a diversified mix of stocks and bonds to get the most return on your investment without taking on too much risk.

Finally, you should focus on cutting down your monthly expenses as much as possible. Try to find ways to save money on your rent and other monthly bills. You may also want to consider picking up a part-time job to help boost your savings.
