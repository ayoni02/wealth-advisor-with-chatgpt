give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Given the limited information provided, some good financial advice for this person would be to start saving as much as possible for retirement. This could include contributing the maximum amount to a 401(k) or IRA account, and/or investing in a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other retirement accounts. Additionally, this person should try to reduce their monthly expenses as much as possible and increase their income by earning promotions or raises at work. Another good idea would be to invest in a Side Hustle to generate additional income.
