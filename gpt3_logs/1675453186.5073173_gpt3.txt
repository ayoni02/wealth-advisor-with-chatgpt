give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

The first thing to do is figure out where all the money is going. Track every penny for a month to get an accurate idea of where the money is going. After that, make a budget and see where there are areas where money could be saved. For example, eating out could be cut down, or less expensive brands could be purchased. 

The next step would be to start contributing to a retirement savings plan, such as a 401k or an IRA. The sooner this is started, the better, as retirement may seem like a long way off, but it will come sooner than expected. Begin by contributing as much as possible, and then increase the amount as salary increases. 

Lastly, it is important to have an emergency fund in case of unexpected expenses. This fund should be in a savings account and have enough money to cover 3-6 months of living expenses. This will help to ensure that if something comes up, there is not the added stress of financial insecurity.
