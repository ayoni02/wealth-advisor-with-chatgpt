imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 30000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 6000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = debts

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

The individual in question is a woman with a salary of $30,000, no investment returns, renting at $600 per month, and having monthly expenses of $500. Given these circumstances, the best financial advice would be to focus on paying off debts as quickly as possible. One way to do this would be to create a budget and allocate any extra income towards paying off debts. Once debts are paid off, the individual can then focus on saving money and creating a safety net in case of unexpected expenses.
