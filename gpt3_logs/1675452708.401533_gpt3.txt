imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 30000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 4000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = car

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

:

Because this person's financial goals involve buying a car, they should focus on saving as much money as possible. One of the best ways to save money is to create a budget and sticking to it. This will help the person to track their expenses and see where they can cut back in order to save more money. Another way to save money is to invest it in something that will give you a return, such as a savings account or a CD.
