Some good financial advice for a person in this situation would be to:

- Save: Make sure to put some money into savings each month so that you have a cushion to fall back on in case of unexpected expenses or financial emergencies.

- Invest: Try to invest some of your money so that you can grow your wealth over time. This can be done through things like stock market investing, real estate investing, or starting your own business.

- Live below your means: Try to live below your means so that you are not spending all of your money each month and putting yourself at risk of financial hardship. Try to find ways to save money on your monthly expenses and live a more frugal lifestyle.

- Have a retirement plan: Itâ€™s important to have a retirement plan in place so that you know how you will support yourself financially once you retire. Try to save as much as possible for retirement and consider investing in things like a 401k or an IRA.
