give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming this person is looking for comprehensive financial advice, here are a few tips:

1. Make sure you are contributing enough to your 401k or other retirement account each month. At a bare minimum, you should be contributing enough to receive any employer matching contributions. If you can afford to do more, consider contributing up to the IRS maximum of $19,500 per year (or $26,000 if you’re over 50).

2. Make sure you have an emergency fund saved up. This should be enough to cover 3-6 months of living expenses in case you lose your job or have another financial emergency.

3. Invest in a diversified mix of assets including stocks, bonds, and cash. Consider using a target date fund if you’re not sure where to start.

4. Pay down high interest debt, such as credit card debt, as quickly as possible.

5. Make a budget and stick to it. Track your spending to see where you can cut back.

6. Consider meeting with a financial advisor to get professional help with planning for your financial future.
