Given this person's financial situation, the best financial advice would be to focus on saving money each month. This person should aim to save at least 10% of their salary each month, in order to reach their financial goals. Additionally, this person should try to invest their money in order to grow their savings. One way to do this would be to open a retirement account and start contributing to it each month. Another way to invest money would be to purchase stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.
