give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming you would like advice for the financial situation given: 

My top advice would be to start saving as soon as possible. Even if itâ€™s just $20 a week, putting that money into a savings account or even a mutual fund can start to add up over time. Another suggestion would be to try and invest in something with a higher return than 0%. For example, bonds typically have a higher return than 0%. Doing this could help grow the money you have saved quicker.

In addition, I would recommend looking at your monthly expenses and seeing if there are any areas where you can cut back. For example, if you are spending $100 a month on coffee, eating out, and other small expenses, try cutting back to $50 a month. This can free up an extra $50 that can be put into savings.

Finally, I would recommend setting a financial goal. Having a specific goal in mind, such as saving for a vacation, can help motivate you to save. Make sure to set a realistic goal that you can actually achieve.
