Assuming you would like tips for improving the financial situation: 

 Perhaps the first step would be to calculate her net salary, which would be her salary minus her monthly expenses. This would give her a better idea of how much she has to work with each month. From there, she could start looking into ways to invest her money and grow her savings. One option might be to open a high-yield savings account, which would help her save money while also earning interest on her deposited funds. Another option might be to consider investing in a mutual fund or another type of investment vehicle. She could also look into ways to reduce her monthly expenses, such as negotiating her rent or looking for cheaper housing. Lastly, she should develop a financial goal and plan for how to achieve it. For example, if she is saving for a vacation, she should calculate how much she will need to save and set up a budget to make sure she stays on track.
