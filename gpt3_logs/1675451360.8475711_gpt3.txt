give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

First and foremost, the person should focus on eliminating their debts as soon as possible. To do this, they will need to create a budget and stick to it strictly. They may need to sacrifice some of their monthly expenses in order to free up more money to put towards their debts. Once their debts are paid off, they can start working on saving up some money. It is a good idea to have at least 3-6 months' worth of living expenses saved up in case of an emergency. The person should also consider investing some of their money in order to grow their wealth over time.
