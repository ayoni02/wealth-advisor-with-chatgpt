==========

Save

The first thing you need to do is save. You should create a budget and make sure you are automatically transferring a fixed percentage of your salary into savings. This will help you make headway on your financial goals.

Invest

Even though you have not seen returns from investments in the past, it is still important to invest for the future. You should consider using a robo-advisor to help you get started with investing.

Education

Your financial goal is to save for education. You should consider community college as a cheaper option for your education. You should also look into scholarship and grant opportunities. You can also start a savings plan specifically for your education.
