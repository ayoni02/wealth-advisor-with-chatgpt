sex = male

returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 1000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = business

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

A good financial plan for this person would be to save at least 10% of their salary each month, invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks and rental properties, and to keep their monthly expenses low. This person should also aim to pay off any debts they have as soon as possible.
