Assuming this person's goal is to pay off debts, the first and most important piece of advice would be to create a budget and stick to it. This person should track all monthly income and expenses in order to get a clear picture of where their money is going. Once this budget is created, they can start to focus on paying down their debts.

Some other tips for this person would be to reduce their monthly expenses as much as possible, and to try to bring in additional income through side hustles or investing. Paying off debts can be a long and difficult process, but following a budget and making extra payments whenever possible can help to speed up the process.
