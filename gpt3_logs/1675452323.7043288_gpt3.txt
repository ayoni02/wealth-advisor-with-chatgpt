imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 30000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 8000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = debts

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Some good financial advice for someone in this situation would be to cut back on their monthly expenses as much as possible, and to use their savings to pay off their debts. If they are unable to do this, they may want to consider consolidation or refinancing their debt.
