The biggest financial goal for this person should be to save for their future education costs. As a male, this person will likely face higher education costs than a female due to gender disparities.

The individual should focus on building up their savings so that they can cover the costs of tuition, room and board, and other associated expenses. They should consider ways to reduce their monthly expenses, such as cutting back on spending on unnecessary items. One way to do this is to create a budget and track their spending so that they are aware of where their money is going each month.

They should also think about ways to increase their income, such as getting a promotion or earning additional income through side hustles. Another way to grow their savings is to invest their money in productive assets such as stocks, real estate, or mutual funds. By doing this, they can potentially earn a return on their investment that can help grow their savings even further.

Ultimately, the goal is for this person to have enough saved up so that they can pay for their education without having to take on excessive debt. By following these financial advice tips, they can put themselves in a better position to reach their goal.
