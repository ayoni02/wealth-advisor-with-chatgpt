give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming this person is looking for comprehensive financial advice, here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. Invest your money wisely. Many people recommend investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash so that you can minimize risk while still earning a return on your investment.

2. Make a budget and stick to it. This will help you keep track of your monthly expenses and make sure you are not spending more than you can afford.

3. Save your money. Try to put away at least 10% of your income into savings so that you have a cushion in case of unexpected expenses.

4. Have financial goals. It is important to have specific goals in mind so that you can work towards them. In this case, the goal is to save up for a car. Try to break down this goal into smaller goals so that it is more achievable. For example, you could save up $500 for a down payment on a car within the next 6 months.

5. Seek professional help if needed. If you are having trouble sticking to a budget or reaching your financial goals, consider seeking professional help from a financial advisor.
