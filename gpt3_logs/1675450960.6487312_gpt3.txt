imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 10000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 0
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = vacation

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Unless this person has other sources of income, it will be difficult for him to save up for a vacation. He should try to reduce his monthly expenses by cutting down on unnecessary costs. He could also look into ways to increase his income, such as asking for a raise or finding a higher paying job. Another option would be to invest his money in something that will generate returns, such as a stocks or mutual funds.
