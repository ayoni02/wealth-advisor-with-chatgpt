imagine a person with the following financial situation;

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming this person wants advice on how to save money and reach their goal of buying a home, here are a few pieces of advice: 

1. Invest in a high yield savings account or a short term CD so that your money can grow while keeping it relatively accessible.

2. Make a budget and stick to it! Look at your monthly expenses and see where you can cut back, even by a little bit. Every bit counts when you're trying to save.

3. Make extra payments on your rent each month so that you can start building equity in your home. Equity can be used as a down payment when you're ready to buy a house.

4. Invest in yourself! Taking courses or learning new skills can help you earn a higher salary, which will in turn help you save more money.
