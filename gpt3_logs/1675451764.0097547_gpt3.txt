==========

Assuming you would like financial advice for this person: 

It is important to start saving as soon as possible. Even if it is a small amount, it is important to start building up your savings. Try to have at least 3-6 months of living expenses saved so that you have a cushion in case of an unexpected event.

Next, invest in yourself by taking courses or learning about new subjects that can help you in your career. It is also important to network and build relationships with people in your industry.

Finally, have a clear goal in mind for what you want to achieve financially. Whether it is to start your own business, save for a down payment on a house, or retire early, knowing your goal will help you make better financial decisions.
