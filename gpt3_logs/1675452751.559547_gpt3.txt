==========

Assuming this person is in their 20s or 30s, a good financial plan for them would be to invest in a diversified mix of assets including stocks, bonds, and cash. They should also consider saving for retirement by contributing to a 401k or IRA. Another goal could be to save up for a down payment on a house. This person should also try to keep their monthly expenses low and build up their savings.
