The first thing that this person should do is to invest in a retirement plan. This will allow her to save money for her future and also get some tax benefits. She should also try to invest in some other assets such as stocks or mutual funds to help grow her savings. Additionally, she should try to reduce her monthly expenses by cutting back on unnecessary purchases and putting more money into savings. Finally, she should make sure to have a financial goal in mind so that she can stay on track with her finances.
