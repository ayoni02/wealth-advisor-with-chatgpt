Assuming this person wants advice on how to save money: 

The best way to save money is to have a plan and to be disciplined. Figure out how much you need to save on a monthly or yearly basis to reach your financial goal. Then, make sure you stick to your plan and don’t dip into your savings account unless it’s an absolute emergency.

One tip to help you stay on track is to set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your savings account. This way, you’ll never even see the money and you’ll be less tempted to spend it.

Another great way to save money is to cut back on your expenses. figure out what monthly expenses are absolutely necessary and which ones you can live without. For example, you may be able to save money on your car insurance by switching to a different provider or you may be able to save on your groceries by couponing.

Finally, make sure you invest your money wisely. There are a lot of different investment options out there and it can be difficult to choose the right one. However, if you do your research and work with a financial advisor, you should be able to find an investment that’s right for you and will help you reach your financial goals.
