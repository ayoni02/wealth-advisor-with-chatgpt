imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 40000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 9000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = retirement

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Some good financial advice for a person with this financial situation would be as follows:

- Save: Try to put away at least 10% of your income into savings, so that you have a cushion to fall back on in case of unexpected expenses.

- Invest: Even if your return from investment is 0%, it is still important to try to grow your savings by investing in some form of interest-bearing account.

- Rent: If your rent/month is 9000, you may want to consider finding a cheaper place to live in order to free up some extra cash each month.

- Expenses: Try to be mindful of your monthly expenses and see if there are any areas where you can cut back, such as eating out or subscription services.

- Goals: Retirement may seem like a long way off, but it is important to start saving for it now if you want to have a comfortable retirement. Try to contribute as much as you can to a retirement account each month.
