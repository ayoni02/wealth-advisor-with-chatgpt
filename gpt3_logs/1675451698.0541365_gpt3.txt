give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

There are a few things that this person can do in order to improve their financial situation and achieve their goal of owning a home.

First, the person should try to increase their income by either getting a raise at their current job or finding a higher paying job. Even a small increase in income can make a big difference when it comes to saving for a home.

Second, the person should focus on reducing their monthly expenses. Even small cuts to expenses can free up a significant amount of money that can be put towards savings.

Third, the person should start investing their money. Even if the investments do not generate a lot of return initially, over time they can compound and grow into a significant amount of money.

Fourth, the person should focus on building up their savings. By setting aside money each month and not touching it, the person can grow their savings significantly over time.

By following these steps, the person can improve their financial situation and eventually achieve their goal of owning a home.
