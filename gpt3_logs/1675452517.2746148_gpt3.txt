imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 30000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 1000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = home

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

The best financial advice for this person would be to work on increasing their income and bringing down their monthly expenses. One way to do this would be to invest in a higher paying job or to make wise investments that will generate passive income. Another way to save money each month would be to cut down on expenses, such as by eating out less often or downsizing to a smaller home. This person should also focus on building up their savings so that they can eventually reach their financial goal of buying a home.
