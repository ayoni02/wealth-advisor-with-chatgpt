Assuming you would like advice for the person with the given financial situation: 

First, the individual should assess their current financial status and make a budget. This will help them to get an idea of their current expenditure and what could be cut back in order to save money. After creating a budget, it is important to set financial goals. This could be short-term goals, such as saving for a vacation, or long-term goals, such as saving for retirement. Once goals are set, the individual can start to work on a plan to save money. This may include setting up a savings account and contributing to it regularly, investing money, and looking for ways to reduce expenses.
