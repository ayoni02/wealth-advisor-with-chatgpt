imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 20000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 6000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = debts

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Good financial advice for this person would be to focus on their debts and try to pay them off as quickly as possible. This will help to free up some of their monthly income and allow them to start saving money. They should also focus on reducing their monthly expenses so that they can save more money each month.
