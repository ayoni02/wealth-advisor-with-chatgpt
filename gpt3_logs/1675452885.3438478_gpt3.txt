imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 30000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 5000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = emergency

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming this person would like good comprehensive financial advice, the following are some recommendations: 

1. Make a budget: Review monthly expenses and make changes where necessary in order to save. Try to have at least 3-6 months of living expenses saved in case of an emergency.

2. Invest: Review different investment options and decide what would work best based on goals and risk tolerance. Begin to invest monthly in order to grow savings.

3. Pay off debt: High interest debt should be a priority to pay off. Use any extra money each month to make additional payments towards debt.

4. Build credit: Use credit wisely in order to build a good credit score. This will help in the future when making large purchases or taking out loans.

5. Save for retirement: Begin saving for retirement as early as possible. The sooner you start saving, the more time your money has to grow.
