imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 40000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 5000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = debts

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming that this person has no other debts, the first thing I would recommend is to create a budget. This will help to get a clear understanding of where their money is going each month and where they can cut back in order to save. I would also recommend looking into investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds in order to build up their savings. Finally, I would advise this person to create a plan to pay off their debts as quickly as possible. This may involve making some sacrifices in their monthly budget, but it will be worth it in the long run.
