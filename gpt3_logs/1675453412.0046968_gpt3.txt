2. Secondly, you should start thinking about your long-term financial goals, such as saving for a home deposit, and invest in a diversified mix of assets that can provide you with good returns over the long term.

3. Thirdly, you should try to reduce your monthly expenses by cutting back on unnecessary expenses and make sure that you are using your credit card wisely.

4. Finally, you should seek professional financial advice from a qualified financial advisor to help you develop a comprehensive financial plan that meets your specific needs and goals.
