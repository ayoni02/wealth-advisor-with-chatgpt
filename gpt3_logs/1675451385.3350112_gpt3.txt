What you should do:

- Make a budget and track your spending. Figure out where your money is going each month and see where you can cut back.
- Try to bring in more income. Can you get a raise at work or make money through side hustles?
- Create a debt payment plan. Make a list of all your debts from smallest to largest and start making payments on the smallest one first. Once that debt is paid off, move on to the next one.
- Build up your savings. Try to put away at least $50 per week into savings. This can help you cover unexpected expenses and reach your financial goals.
- Invest in yourself. Make sure you are taking care of your health and wellbeing. This includes maintaining a healthy lifestyle, getting enough sleep, and managing stress levels.
