It is important to save money each month in order to reach financial goals. In this case, the individual should look into ways to reduce their monthly expenses by cutting down on unnecessary costs. They should also try to increase their income by looking for promotions or earning additional income through freelance work or investments. Once the individual has built up a reasonable amount of savings, they can then start to consider making bigger financial goals, such as purchasing a car.
