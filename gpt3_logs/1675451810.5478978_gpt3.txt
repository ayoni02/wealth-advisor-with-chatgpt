==========

Assuming you would like financial advice for this person: 

First, this person should assess their net worth. This includes subtracting any debts they may have from their total assets. This will give them a clear picture of their financial situation. From there, they can start working on creating a budget and explore how they can best save money.

Ideally, this person should try to save at least 3-6 months of their living expenses in an emergency fund. This will help them cover unexpected costs if they ever lose their job or have another financial emergency.

Next, this person should focus on their financial goals. If their goal is to start a business, they should start researching how much money they will need to start their business and create a plan to save that amount of money.

This person should also consider investing some of their money. They can research different investment options and decide which one will work best for them based on their goals and risk tolerance.

Overall, this person should try to create a holistic financial plan that includes savings, investing, and budgeting. By doing this, they will be on their way to financial success.
