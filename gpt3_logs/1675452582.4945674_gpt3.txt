==========

There are a few things that this person could do in order to improve their financial situation. Firstly, they could start by looking into ways to increase their income, whether that be through getting a raise at their current job or finding a new, higher-paying job altogether. Additionally, they could work on lowering their monthly expenses by finding ways to cut back on their spending. One way to do this could be to create a budget and stick to it, only spending money on essential items and cutting back on non-essential purchases. Finally, this person could also start putting away money into savings on a regular basis so that they have a cushion to fall back on in case of an unexpected expense.
