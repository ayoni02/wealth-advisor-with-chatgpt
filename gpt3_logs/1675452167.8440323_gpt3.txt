imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 20000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 9000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = emergency

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming you would like advice for the male with the salary of $20,000, rental expenses of $9,000, monthly expenses of $500, and $0 in savings: 

Your first step should be to contribute to an emergency fund that will cover 3-6 months of living expenses. This will help you cover unexpected costs in the future and provide peace of mind. Once you have built up your emergency fund, you can start investing in other goals.

Another priority should be to pay down high-interest debt, such as credit card debt. This will free up more of your income to save and invest in the future.

You may also want to consider increasing your income by working overtime or finding a higher paying job. This will give you more money to work with each month.

Finally, you should establish a budget and stick to it. This will help you track your expenses and ensure that you are not overspending.

By following these steps, you will be on your way to financial success.
