==========

Start by looking at your current financial situation and goal. You will need to make some changes in order to meet your goal of paying off debts.

You are currently spending more money than you are bringing in each month. You need to break this cycle by find ways to either lower your monthly expenses or increase your income. One way to do this is to create a budget and track your spending so that you are aware of where your money is going each month.

You also need to make sure that you are making wise choices with your money. Invest in things that will help you reach your goal of becoming debt-free. This may include using some of your money to pay off high-interest debt, such as credit cards. It may also include investing in a debt consolidation loan to lower your monthly payments.

Making some changes to your spending and saving habits will help you reach your financial goals. However, it is also important to seek professional help if you are struggling with debt. A financial advisor can help you create a plan to get out of debt and make sound financial choices in the future.
