give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

First, the person should make sure that their monthly expenses do not exceed their income. Second, they should work on accumulating some savings. After these two goals are accomplished, the person can begin to focus on their financial goals. One suggestion would be to Invest in a business that they are passionate about. This will not only help them make money, but will also be fulfilling. Another suggestion would be to invest in stocks or mutual funds. This can be a more passive way to grow their wealth. However, it is important to remember to diversify their investments so that they are not all put into one category.
