==========

First, take a look at your goals. Do you want to pay off debts, save up for a specific goal, or both? If you're looking to pay off debts, you'll need to focus on that first. Make a budget and see where you can cut back on expenses in order to put more towards your debts each month. You may also want to look into getting a part-time job to help boost your monthly income. Once your debts are paid off, you can start saving up for your other goals. Make sure to put money into a savings account each month so that you're prepared for anything that comes up.
