Save as much money as possible each month. Try to put away at least 10% of your salary into savings. Invest in a diversified mix of stocks and bonds. Consider saving for retirement in a 401(k) or IRA. Make sure you are staying on top of your monthly expenses and rent. Try to keep your monthly expenses below 30% of your income. Try to pay off any debt you may have as soon as possible. If you have any extra money each month, consider investing it in your business.
