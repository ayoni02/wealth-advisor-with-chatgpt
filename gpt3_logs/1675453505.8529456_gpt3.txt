give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming this person wants good financial advice, here are a few things to consider:

1. Make a budget and stick to it. Determine what your monthly income is and track where every dollar goes. This will help you get a better understanding of your spending patterns and where you can cut back.

2. Invest in yourself. Make sure you are contributing to your retirement accounts and taking advantage of any employer matching contributions. Investing in yourself now will pay off in the future.

3. Consider putting some money into investments outside of traditional retirement accounts. This could include stocks, mutual funds, or even real estate. Diversifying your investments will help protect your finances in the long term.

4. Stay disciplined with your spending. It can be easy to overspend when you have a steady income, but it is important to live within your means. Try to avoid buying things on credit and, instead, save up for big purchases.

5. Build up your emergency fund. Everyone should have some money set aside in case of unexpected expenses. This will help you avoid going into debt if you have a financial emergency.

6. Make a plan. Determine what your financial goals are and create a plan to achieve them. Without a plan, it will be difficult to make progress towards your goals.

7. Get professional help. If you are struggling to get your finances in order, consider seeking out the help of a financial planner. They can help you create a custom plan to achieve your financial goals.
