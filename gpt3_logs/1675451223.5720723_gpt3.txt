give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming you would like advice for this person in their current situation: 

Firstly, the person should focus on building up their savings. Even though their salary is not high, they should aim to save at least 10% of their income each month. This will help them to build up a cushion of money that can be used in case of emergencies or unexpected expenses.

Secondly, the person should try to reduce their monthly expenses. One way to do this is to track their spending for a month to see where they can cut back. For example, they may be spending too much on eating out or on unnecessary items. Once they have identified areas where they can cut back, they can focus on saving more money each month.

Thirdly, the person should consider investing their money. Even though returns from investments may be low at the moment, investing money can help to grow their savings over time. The person should research different investment options and look for ones that fit their financial goals and risk tolerance.

Fourthly, the person should create a budget. This will help them to track their income and expenses, and to make sure that they are not spending more than they can afford. Creating a budget can be a helpful way to stay on track with financial goals.

Overall, the most important thing for this person to do is to focus on saving money. By doing this, they will be better prepared for unexpected expenses and will be able to reach their financial goals.
