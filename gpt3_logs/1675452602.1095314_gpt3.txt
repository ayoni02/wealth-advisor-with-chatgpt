sex = female
salary = 30000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 2000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = business

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

If you are a woman with a salary of $30000 and no investment returns, your monthly rent should be $2000 and your monthly expenses should be $500. You should also have some savings so that you can reach your financial goals.
