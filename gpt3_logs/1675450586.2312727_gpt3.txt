Assuming you would like tips on saving and reaching the financial goal of paying for education: 

1. Save: Try to have at least 3-6 months of living expenses saved so that you have a cushion in case of job loss or unexpected expenses. If you can't save that much right away, start small and gradually increase your savings over time.

2. Invest: Consider investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks and mutual funds to help reach your goal. Over time, the goal is to earn enough in returns to cover the cost of education.

3. Cut expenses: Take a close look at your monthly expenses and see where you can cut back, even by a little bit. This will free up more money to put towards savings and investing.

4. Use tax-advantaged accounts: If you have the option, consider using a 401k or IRA account to save for education. Contributions to these accounts are typically tax-deductible, which can help save you money on taxes.

5. Get creative: There are many ways to pay for education these days, so get creative and explore all your options. You may be able to get scholarships, grants, or even take out a student loan.

6. Stay disciplined: It can be easy to lose track of your finances, but it's important to stay disciplined and focused on your goals. Keep tabs on your progress and adjust your strategy as needed to ensure you are on track to reach your goals.
