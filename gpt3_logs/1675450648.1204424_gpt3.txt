==========

First, the individual should focus on building up their savings. They should contribute to a savings account each month in order to have funds available for unexpected expenses or goals. They should also invest in a retirement account such as a 401k or IRA.

Second, the individual should focus on reducing their monthly expenses. One way to do this is to create a budget and stick to it. Another way to reduce expenses is to negotiate lower rates on bills such as car insurance.

Third, the individual should focus on their financial goals. In this case, the goal is to save for education. The individual should create a plan for how much they need to save each month in order to reach their goal. They should also consider taking advantage of tax-free savings accounts such as a 529 plan.
