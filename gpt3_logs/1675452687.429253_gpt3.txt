financial goals = car

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

If you are a woman with a salary of $30000 and no investment returns, you should try to save as much money as possible. You should have a goal of saving up for a car. You should also try to reduce your monthly expenses by cutting out unnecessary costs.
