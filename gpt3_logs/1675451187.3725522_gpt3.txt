imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 10000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 9000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = emergency

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

If you have a regular income of $10,000 and your monthly expenses are $500, you should focus on creating an emergency fund. Try to save at least 3-6 months of living expenses so that you have a buffer in case of a job loss or unexpected expenses. Once you have a solid emergency fund, you can begin investing in other financial goals.
