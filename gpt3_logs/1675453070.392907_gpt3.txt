imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 40000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 3000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = debts

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming that this person has no outstanding debts, the best financial advice for her would be to start saving as much money as possible. She should try to put away at least 10% of her salary into savings every month, and if possible, she should try to find ways to increase her income so that she can save even more. Once she has a decent amount of savings, she can then start investing her money and working towards her financial goals.
