imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 10000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 6000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = emergency

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

The person's financial situation suggests that they are not very well-off, and are struggling to make ends meet. They would benefit from some financial advice in order to improve their situation.

An obvious place to start would be to try and increase their income by looking for a better-paid job. However, given the current state of the economy, this may not be possible or may not be enough to make a significant difference.

Reducing their monthly expenses would also be a good idea. There are a number of ways to do this, such as cutting back on unnecessary expenses, negotiating better deals with service providers, and so on.

Another option would be to try and increase their returns from investment. This could involve taking on more risk, but if done carefully it could lead to greater rewards.

Finally, the person should make sure that they have some savings set aside for emergencies. This will help to ensure that they are not caught short if something unexpected happens.
