imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 10000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 6000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = debts

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

If you are a female with a salary of 10000 and your investment returns are 0, your monthly rent is 6000, and your monthly expenses are 500, you may want to consider debt consolidation. This will allow you to reduce your monthly payments and save money in the long run. You may also want to consider saving money each month to help pay off your debts and reach your financial goals.
