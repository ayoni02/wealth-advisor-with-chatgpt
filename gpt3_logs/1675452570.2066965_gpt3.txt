imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female

monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = home

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming the individual's financial goal is to purchase a home, the following financial advice can be provided: 

1. aggressively save for a down payment - the individual should aim to save at least 20% of the home's value for a down payment in order to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI) 
2. invest in a higher yielding savings account or mutual fund - by doing this, the individual can earn more on their savings and reach their goal more quickly 
3. create a budget and stick to it - knowing where all of their money is going will help the individual to save more effectively 
4. research various mortgage options - there are a number of different mortgage products available and it's important to find the one that best suits the individual's needs 
5. stay disciplined - it can be easy to overspend when working towards a large financial goal like purchasing a home, but it's important to remain disciplined in order to reach the goal as quickly as possible
