If you are looking to get out of debt as soon as possible, you will need to create a budget and focus on paying off your debts with any extra money that you have. You may need to make some sacrifices in your monthly expenses in order to free up more money to put towards your debts. You should also consider ways to bring in additional income, such as getting a second job or finding ways to make money from investments. Once you have paid off your debts, you can start to build up your savings so that you are prepared for future financial goals.
