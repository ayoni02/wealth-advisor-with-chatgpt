imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 30000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 8000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = emergency

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Such a person would be advised to save as much money as possible in order to have a cushion in case of any unforeseen circumstances. One way to do this would be to invest in a high yield savings account or a short-term certificate of deposit. Another way to save money would be to create a budget and stick to it strictly in order to reduce monthly expenses. Once savings are increased, this person may want to consider investing in a longer-term goal, such as retirement.
