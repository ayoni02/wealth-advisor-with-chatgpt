==========

If you are a male with a salary of 20000, returns from investment of 0, rent/month of 6000, monthly expenses of 500, savings of 0, and financial goals of education, then you should work on building up your savings. Try to save at least 10% of your income each month so that you can have funds available for your future goals. Invest in a mix of stocks and mutual funds so that you can get the most return on investment. Consider opening a Roth IRA so that you can save for retirement and take advantage of tax breaks. Make sure to pay your rent on time so that you don't damage your credit score.
