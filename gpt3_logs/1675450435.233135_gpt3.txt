imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 10000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 7000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = debts

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

If you are a male with a salary of 10000 and have no investment returns, you should try to save as much money as possible. You should try to find a cheaper place to live, and cut back on your monthly expenses. If you have any debts, you should try to pay them off as soon as possible.
