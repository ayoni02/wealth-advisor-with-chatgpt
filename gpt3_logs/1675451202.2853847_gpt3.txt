imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 10000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 1000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = other

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

It is difficult to give good financial advice without knowing the person's financial goals. However, some general advice would be to start saving as much money as possible and to invest in a mix of different types of investments in order to diversify their risk. Additionally, the person should try to reduce their monthly expenses where possible in order to increase their savings.
