Assuming you would like tips for improving the financial situation: 

First, the individual should try to increase their salary if possible. If they are unable to do this, they should look for ways to cut their monthly expenses. One way to do this would be to find a cheaper place to live. The individual could also try to get rid of any unneeded expenses, such as cable or a gym membership. It would also be beneficial to start investing some of their money, even if the returns are small. Doing this could help the individual reach their financial goals quicker. Finally, the individual should try to build up their savings. Even putting away a small amount each month can help in the long run.
