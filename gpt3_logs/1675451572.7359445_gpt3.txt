==========

The most important thing for this person to do is to create a budget and stick to it. This will help her get a better handle on her monthly expenses and allow her to save money each month. She should also consider investing in a high-yield savings account or a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) to earn some interest on her savings. When it comes to her financial goal of saving for education, she should consider opening a 529 college savings plan. This will allow her to save for education tax-free and most states offer tax deductions for contributions to a 529 plan.
