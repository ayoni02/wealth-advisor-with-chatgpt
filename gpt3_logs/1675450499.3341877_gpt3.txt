==========

Start by contributing enough to your employerâ€™s 401k plan to get the full employer match. For example, if your employer offers a 3% match, you should contribute at least 3% of your salary to your 401k. This is free money that will go towards your retirement savings.

Next, focus on building up your emergency fund. You should aim to have 3-6 months of living expenses saved in a safe, liquid account. This will help you cover unexpected expenses without having to rely on credit cards or loans.

Once you have built up your emergency fund, you can start saving for retirement. The earlier you start saving, the more time your money has to grow. Consider saving 15-20% of your income for retirement. You may want to use a combination of a 401k, IRA, and/or taxable investment accounts to reach your retirement savings goals.

Finally, make sure you are staying on top of your monthly expenses. Review your budget regularly to make sure you are not overspending in any one category. It is also important to keep an eye on your rent/mortgage payments and make sure they are in line with your income.
