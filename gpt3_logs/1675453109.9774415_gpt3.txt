==========

There are a few key things that this person should do in order to get their finances in order. First, they should make a budget and track their spending. This will help them to see where their money is going and where they can cut back. They should also make sure to put some money into savings each month, even if it is just a small amount. They should also try to pay off their debts as quickly as possible.
