==========

Create an emergency fund:

The most important thing for this person to do is to create an emergency fund. This will help them cover unexpected costs in the event that something unexpected comes up. They should aim to save up at least 3-6 months worth of living expenses. Once they have done this, they can start thinking about other financial goals.

 Investments:

This person might want to consider investments as a way to help grow their money. However, they should be aware that there are risk involved with any type of investment. They should speak with a financial advisor to learn more about different investment options and to find out what might be the best fit for their goals and risk tolerance.

Financial goals:

In addition to creating an emergency fund, this person should also set some financial goals. They may want to consider saving for a down payment on a house or for retirement. Speaking with a financial advisor can help them create a plan to reach their goals.
