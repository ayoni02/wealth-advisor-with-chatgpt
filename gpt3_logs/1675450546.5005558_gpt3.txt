sex = female
salary = 10000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 8000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = retirement

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Some good financial advice for this person would be to invest in a retirement plan, such as a 401k or an IRA. They should also try to save as much money as possible each month, even if it is just a little bit. They should also look into ways to reduce their monthly expenses, such as cutting back on unnecessary spending or finding ways to save on their rent.
