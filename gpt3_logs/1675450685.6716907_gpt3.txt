imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female

returns from investment = 0

savings = 0
financial goals = home

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

There are a few things that this person can do in order to improve their financial situation. One thing that they could do is to start saving money each month. Even if it is just a small amount, it can add up over time. Another thing that they could do is to invest their money in a good mutual fund or stock portfolio. This could help them to make some money back on their investment and make their money work for them. Lastly, they could try to negotiate a lower rent payment with their landlord. If they are able to do this, it would free up some extra money each month to put towards their financial goals.
