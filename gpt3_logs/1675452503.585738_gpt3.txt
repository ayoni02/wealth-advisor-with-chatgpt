imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 30000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 9000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = education

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Some things to consider for financial advice would be to first look at the monthly expenses and see where there may be some room for cuts. It may also be beneficial to investigate cheaper living arrangements in order to save on the monthly rent. Furthermore, saving is always important and even though the returns from investment may be low, it is still beneficial to save what you can each month. Finally, financial goals are important to have in order to stay motivated and focused. For this person, since the goal is education, advice would be to look into scholarships and grants as a way to ease the financial burden.
