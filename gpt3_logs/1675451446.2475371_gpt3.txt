The first step is to map out all of your expenses and figure out where your money is going each month. It is important to make sure that your monthly expenses are covered by your income and that you have enough left over to save for your future goals. In this case, the goal is retirement.

One of the most important things you can do is to make sure you are contributing to a retirement savings account each month. If your employer offers a retirement savings plan, such as a 401(k), you should be contributing at least enough to receive the employer match. If you are not eligible for an employer-sponsored retirement plan, you can open an Individual Retirement Account (IRA).

You should also make sure you are taking advantage of any other tax-advantaged savings opportunities, such as a Health Savings Account (HSA) if you have a high deductible health insurance plan.

Once you have your monthly expenses under control and are saving for retirement, you can start thinking about other financial goals, such as buying a house or saving for a rainy day fund.
