Firstly, you should make sure that you are contributing enough to your retirement savings plan to get the maximum employer match, if your company offers one. If you are not contributing enough to take advantage of the employer match, you are leaving money on the table.

Secondly, you should make sure that you are diversified across a number of different asset classes in order to maximize your returns and minimize your risk.

Thirdly, you should make sure that you are budgeting your monthly expenses in order to stay on track with your financial goals.

Fourthly, you should make sure that you have an emergency fund in place in case of unexpected expenses.

Finally, you should consult with a financial advisor to make sure that you are on track to reach your financial goals.
