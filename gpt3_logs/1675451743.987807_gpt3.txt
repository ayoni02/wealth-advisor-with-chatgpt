imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 20000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 2000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = business

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

There are a few things that this person can do in order to improve their financial situation. One option would be to invest their money in a business. This could potentially give them a higher return on their investment than if they were to keep their money in a savings account. Another option would be to try to save up some money each month so that they can eventually buy a house or an apartment. This would allow them to get rid of their monthly expenses and potentially make some money each month from rent.
