==========

Assuming the person is employed, she should start by contributing to a 401k or similar retirement savings plan if her employer offers one. If not, she should open a Roth IRA and contribute the maximum amount allowed each year. She should also start an emergency fund of 3-6 months of living expenses. Once she has done that, she should focus on her financial goals.

If she wants to buy a home, she should start by saving for a down payment of at least 20%. She can do this by opening a savings account and setting up automatic transfers from her checking account each month. She should also shop around for a mortgage with a good interest rate. Once she has a down payment saved up, she can start looking for a home.

If she wants to save for other financial goals, she should set up a savings account and automate her transfers each month. She can also consider investing in a stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.
