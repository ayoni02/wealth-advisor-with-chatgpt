The best financial advice for this person would be to invest in a retirement plan as soon as possible. It is important to start saving for retirement early, and a retirement plan will help this person do just that. The sooner this person begins investing in a retirement plan, the more time their money will have to grow. Additionally, this person should make sure to have at least 3-6 months of living expenses saved up in an emergency fund in case of unforeseen circumstances.
