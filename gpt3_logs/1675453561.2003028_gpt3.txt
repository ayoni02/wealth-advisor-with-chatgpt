Assuming you would like advice on how to save: 

Start by looking at your expenses and see what you can cut out or reduce. For example, if you are eating out often, try cooking at home more. If you have a gym membership, see if there are any free or outdoor options available to you. Once you have trimmed your expenses, you can start to focus on saving. 

Create a budget and make sure to include a line item for savings. Begin with $50-$100 per month, and increase the amount as you are able. Automate your savings by having the money transferred to a separate account as soon as you are paid. This will help you to avoid the temptation of spending it. 

Invest your money wisely. Consider using a mix of high-yield savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and index funds. This will help you to grow your money while still keeping it relatively safe.

Finally, make a plan for your financial goals. Decide how much you will need to save in order to reach your goal. For example, if you want to buy a car, research the prices of the type of car you would like and create a savings plan accordingly. Try to break your goal down into smaller, manageable steps so that it does not seem so daunting. 

By following these steps, you can get your finances on track and reach your financial goals.
