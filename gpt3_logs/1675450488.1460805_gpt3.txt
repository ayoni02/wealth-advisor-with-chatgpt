==========

Firstly, the individual should create a budget in order to get a holistic view of her monthly inflows and outflows of cash. Once she has done this, she should look at ways to cut back on her expenses so that she can start saving money each month. One way to do this is by looking at her regular bills and seeing if there are any areas where she can save money, such as by switching to a cheaper energy provider.

Secondly, the individual should start investing her money so that she can grow her savings and reach her financial goals. One way to do this is by opening a retirement account, such as a 401(k) or IRA, and contributing to it regularly. Another way to invest her money is by buying stocks, bonds, or other investments.

Finally, the individual should create a financial plan that outlines her goals and how she intends to achieve them. This plan should take into account her current financial situation, her savings goals, and her investment strategy. By doing this, she will be able to track her progress and make changes to her plan as needed.
