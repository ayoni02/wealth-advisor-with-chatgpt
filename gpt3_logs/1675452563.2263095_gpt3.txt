imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 30000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 7000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = home

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming that this person would like to achieve the goal of owning a home, there are a few key pieces of financial advice that could be given. One, save as much as possible each month in order to have a down payment for a home. Two, invest in a housing market that has historically appreciated in order to make the most on their investment. And lastly, work with a financial advisor to develop a budget and create a plan to save for a home.
