First and foremost, you need to get your financial situation under control. You are currently spending more money than you are bringing in, and this is not sustainable in the long-term. You need to cutting your monthly expenses so that you are living within your means.

In addition, you need to start paying off your debts. This will help to improve your credit score and will free up more of your monthly income to save or invest. You should focus on paying off your high-interest debts first, such as credit cards. You may also want to consider consolidating your debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate.

Finally, you need to start saving for your future. Even if you can only save a small amount each month, it is important to start building up your savings. This will give you a financial cushion to fall back on in case of an emergency, and will help you to reach your long-term financial goals.
