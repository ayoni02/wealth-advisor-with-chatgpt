imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 30000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 2000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = debts

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

The best financial advice for this person would be to create a budget and stick to it. This person should track their monthly income and expenses to see where their money is going. They should also try to pay down their debts as quickly as possible. One way to do this is to make extra payments on their debts each month. Another way to achieve their financial goals would be to save up money to put towards their debts. This person should put money into savings each month so that they have a cushion to fall back on in case of an emergency.
