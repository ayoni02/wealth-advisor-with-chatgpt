imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male

returns from investment = 0

monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = home

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

The first thing to do is to make sure that your monthly expenses do not exceed your income. In this case, you will need to cut back on your expenses by $500 in order to live within your means.

Next, you should focus on building up your savings. Try to save at least 10% of your income each month so that you can reach your financial goals.

If you can discipline yourself to live on a tight budget and save regularly, you will be in a good position to achieve your financial goals.
