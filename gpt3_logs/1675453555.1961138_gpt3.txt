imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 40000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 2000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = car

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

If you are a male with a salary of $40000, you will need to invest in a car. You will need to save up for a down payment, and you will need to make sure that you can afford the monthly payments. You will also need to make sure that you have enough money left over each month to cover your other expenses.
