imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 30000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 1000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = car

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming you would like general financial advice: 

It is always good to have saving goals in mind, whether that is for a rainy day fund or for a larger purchase. Try to put away at least 10% of your salary each month into savings. If your employer offers a 401k plan, contribute enough to get the full employer match. Employer matches are essentially free money.

When you have debt, try to focus on paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first. For investments, choose a mix of low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk options. Diversifying your investment portfolio will help protect you if one particular investment option hits a rough patch. Review your investment options andrisk tolerance with a financial advisor periodically.

If you are renting, consider the long term costs and whether you would like to eventually purchase a home. In some cases, it can be cheaper to buy a home than to rent, but there are also additional costs and responsibilities that come with owning a home.
