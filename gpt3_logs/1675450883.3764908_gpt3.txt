==========

There are a few things that this person can do in order to improve their financial situation. Firstly, they should try to invest some of their money into something that will offer them returns, such as stocks or mutual funds. Secondly, they should try to reduce their monthly expenses by cutting down on unnecessary expenses and/or by finding ways to save money on their monthly bills. Finally, they should try to build up their savings so that they have a cushion to fall back on in case of emergencies.
