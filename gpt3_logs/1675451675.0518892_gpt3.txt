imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 20000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 5000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = home

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Some good financial advice for this person would be to invest in a 401k or Roth IRA, to try and save at least 10% of their salary each month, and to create a budget to track their monthly expenses. This person should also focus on their financial goal of buying a home, and try to save as much money as possible each month to reach this goal.
