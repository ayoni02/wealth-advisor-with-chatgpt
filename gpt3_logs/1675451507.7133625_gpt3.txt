imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 20000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 8000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = retirement

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming you would like specific advice for this person: 

Firstly, the simplest place to start is by looking at expenses. It is clear that this person has a significant amount of debt in the form of rent, which is occupying a large part of their income. Cutting back on some of the other monthly expenses, or finding ways to increase income, could free up some money to put towards rent each month. 

Secondly, this person should consider their financial goals. Retirement is a long-term goal, which means that this person should be thinking about ways to invest their money and grow their savings. Putting money into a retirement fund or a high-yield savings account could help this person reach their goal. 

Lastly, this person should think about how to reduce their overall debt. One way to do this is by consolidating debt into one monthly payment at a lower interest rate. This could save money on interest payments, and help this person pay off their debt more quickly. 

These are just a few ideas to get started. Comprehensive financial advice would need to take into account this person's specific situation in order to be truly effective.
