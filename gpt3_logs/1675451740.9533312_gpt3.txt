imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 20000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 2000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = business

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Ideally, the person should be saving at least 10% of their salary each month. However, since they have some monthly expenses, they may want to save closer to 20% of their salary. They should also try to invest their money in order to earn returns. A good financial goal for this person would be to save up enough money to start their own business.
