imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 10000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 2000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = debts

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming this person has debt, the first piece of advice would be to make a budget and figure out where all of their money is going. From there, they need to focus on paying off their debt as quickly as possible. This means making some sacrifices in their lifestyle, such as cutting back on discretionary spending, in order to put more money towards their debt. Once their debt is paid off, they can start working on building up their savings. It is also important for this person to start thinking about investing for their future. Even if they can only invest a small amount of money each month, it is important to start building up their nest egg.
