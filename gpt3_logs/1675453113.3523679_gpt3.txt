imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 40000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 9000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = debts

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

This person's financial situation is not ideal, as they have a high monthly rent expense and no savings. Their best course of action would be to focus on paying off their debts as quickly as possible, in order to free up more of their income to save and invest. They may also want to consider finding a less expensive place to live, which would allow them to put more money towards their other financial goals.
