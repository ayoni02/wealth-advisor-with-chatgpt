give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming this person wants good comprehensive financial advice, here are a few things that could be recommended.

First, this person should focus on setting up an emergency fund that can cover at least three to six months of living expenses. This will help protect against unexpected life events or income disruptions.

Next, this person should focus on creating a budget and sticking to it. This will help ensure that all expenses are accounted for and that there is room to save each month.

It would also be advisable to start investing for the future. This could be done through retirement accounts such as a 401(k) or IRA, or through other investments such as stocks or mutual funds.

Finally, this person should develop a financial goal list. This could include things like saving for a down payment on a house, starting a business, etc. Having financial goals will help focus and prioritize spending and saving.
