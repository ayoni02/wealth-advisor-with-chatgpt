There are a few things to consider when trying to save up for a car. First, make sure that your monthly expenses are as low as possible so that you have more money available to save. Try to put away at least 10% of your salary each month into savings, and if possible, invest some of your money so that you can earn interest on it. If you can find a way to lower your rent/month, that will also free up more money to save for your car.

One option for saving for a car is to open up a savings account specifically for this purpose. Another option is to get a car loan so that you can finance your car and make monthly payments. If you choose to finance your car, make sure to shop around for the best interest rate so that you can save money in the long run.
