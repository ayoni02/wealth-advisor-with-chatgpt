Assuming you would like tips for this person to improve their financial situation: 

1. Invest in a retirement account such as a 401k or IRA. Both accounts have tax benefits that can help save for retirement. 

2. Try to increase their salary if possible. Even a small raise can have a big impact on saving for retirement. 

3. Cut back on monthly expenses as much as possible. Even small expenses can add up over time and impact savings. 

4. Have a savings goal in mind. Try to save a certain amount each month or year to reach this goal. This will help to stay on track with saving. 

5. Invest in a diversified mix of investments. This can help to mitigate risk and potentially earn higher returns over time.
