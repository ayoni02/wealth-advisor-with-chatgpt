Here are some general tips that may help this person get a handle on their finances: 

-Create a budget: Knowing where your money is going is an important first step in getting your finances under control. Track your monthly income and expenses to get an idea of where your money is being spent. This will help you make informed decisions about where you can cut back or make changes.

-Create a savings plan: Having a savings plan in place will help you reach your financial goals. Automating your savings can help make it easier to reach your targets. Try to put away a fixed percentage of your income each month, or set up a system where you transfer a set amount of money into savings each time you get paid.

-Pay off debts: If your goal is to become debt-free, you'll need to create a plan to pay off what you owe. Start by making a list of all your debts, along with the interest rates and minimum monthly payments. Then, prioritize your debts from highest to lowest interest rate. Make the minimum payment on all your debts, and then use any extra money you have to pay down the debt with the highest interest rate. Once that debt is paid off, you can move on to the next debt on your list.

-Build an emergency fund: An emergency fund can help you cover unexpected expenses without going into debt. Try to save up enough money to cover 3-6 months of living expenses. This will help you weather any financial storms that come your way.

- Invest: Investing is a great way to grow your wealth over time. Consider investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other vehicles to diversify your portfolio. Working with a financial advisor can help you make informed investment choices.
