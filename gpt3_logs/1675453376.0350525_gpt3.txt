There are a few things that this person could do in order to improve their financial situation. One thing that she could do is to start investing her money. Even though she is not currently earning any returns from investments, this is a good way to grow her money over time. Another thing she could do is to try to reduce her monthly expenses. This could involve cutting back on unnecessary expenses, or finding ways to save money on her regular expenses. Finally, she could start saving her money each month. Even if she only saves a small amount each month, this will help her to reach her financial goals.
