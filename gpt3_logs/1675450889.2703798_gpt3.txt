Assuming you would like advice for the person with the financial situation described: 

It is always a good idea to have savings, even if it is a small amount. An emergency fund can help cover unexpected expenses and can help keep you from going into debt. Try to save at least 3-6 months of living expenses.

If you have financial goals, it is important to create a budget and make a plan to save for these goals. Prioritize your goals and create a timeline for saving. For example, if you want to save for a car, you may need to save for a down payment and then make monthly payments.

In order to save money, it is important to be aware of your spending patterns. Track your spending for at least one month to get an idea of where your money goes. Once you know where your money is going, you can make adjustments to your budget to save more.

It is also a good idea to invest some of your money. Even if you donâ€™t have a lot to invest, you can start small. Investing can help you reach your financial goals sooner.

Finally, make sure you are covered with insurance. Health insurance is important to protect yourself and your family. You may also want to consider life insurance, disability insurance, and long-term care insurance.
