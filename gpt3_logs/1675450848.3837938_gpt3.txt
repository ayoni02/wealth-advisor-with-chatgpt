Assuming you would like tips for how this person can improve their financial situation: 

1. The first step would be creating a budget in order to track where all of their money is going each month. This will help them to identify areas where they may be able to cut back on their spending in order to save more money.

2. They should also focus on increasing their income by looking for opportunities to earn more money through promotions, side hustles, or investing in assets such as real estate or stocks.

3. Once they have a better handle on their monthly cash flow, they can start setting aside money each month into a savings account or investing for their future.

4. Finally, they should develop specific financial goals, such as building up an emergency fund or saving for a down payment on a house, and create a plan for how they will achieve those goals.
