What you're doing isn't working. You're barely scraping by and not making any progress towards your goals. You need to make some changes.

First, take a hard look at your expenses. You're spending more than you can afford and it's putting you in a hole every month. See where you can cut back, even if it's just a little bit. Every bit counts.

Next, you need to start making some headway on your savings. You need to have an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses, and you need to start working towards your long-term financial goals. Try to save at least 10% of your income each month. If you can't do that, start with 5% and work your way up.

Finally, you need to start making your money work for you. Investing is a great way to grow your wealth over time. Look into different investment options and figure out what suits you best.

Making these changes won't be easy, but they're necessary if you want to get your finances on track. Stay focused on your goals and don't give up. With a little discipline, you can get your finances under control and start building the future you want.
