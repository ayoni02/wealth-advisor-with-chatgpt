==========

It is important to note that this person has a goal of purchasing a home. With that in mind, the following financial advice should be given:

1. Invest in a 401k or other retirement account: Even though this person is not earning returns from investments currently, it is important to invest for the future. A retirement account will allow this person to save money and receive tax benefits.

2. Save money: This person should make sure to save money each month in order to reach their goal of purchasing a home. One way to do this is to automatically transfer a fixed percentage of their salary into savings.

3. Reduce monthly expenses: This person should try to reduce their monthly expenses in order to save more money. One way to do this is to track their spending and find areas where they can cut back.

4. Get a financial coach: A financial coach can help this person develop a plan to reach their financial goals. A coach can also provide accountability and support to help this person stay on track.
