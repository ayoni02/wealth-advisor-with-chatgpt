give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Given that this individual has a monthly income of $20,000 and monthly expenses of $500, they should focus on building up their savings so that they can eventually pay off their debts. One way to do this is to set aside a certain amount of money each month to put towards their savings. Another way to build up savings is to invest money in accounts that offer interest, such as a savings account, certificate of deposit, or money market account.Finally, this individual should try to reduce their monthly expenses by cutting back on unnecessary costs and/or finding ways to increase their income.
