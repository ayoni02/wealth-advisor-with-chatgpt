==========

Assuming you would like advice for the individual with the given financial situation: 

-The first thing this person should do is create a budget. This will help him/her see where their money is going and where they can cut back on expenses. 

-He/she should also try to increase their income if possible. This could be done by asking for a raise at work or finding a higher paying job. 

-It’s also important to start saving for retirement as soon as possible. The sooner this person starts saving, the more money they will have in retirement. They should try to save at least 10-15% of their income. 

-Investing is also a good way to grow their money. They should research different investment options and find one that best suits their goals and risk tolerance. 

-Lastly, this person should stay disciplined with their finances. It can be easy to overspend or make impulsive purchases, but it’s important to stick to their budget and financial goals.
