Assuming the person is single:

The first thing this person should do is to create a budget and track their spending. It is difficult to make sound financial decisions without knowing where your money is going. Once you have a good understanding of your spending patterns, you can make adjustments to ensure that your monthly expenses do not exceed your income.

Next, this person should focus on paying down their debts. High interest debt, such as credit card debt, can be very costly and take years to pay off if only making the minimum monthly payment. By focusing on paying down debt, this person can save money in the long run and free up more money each month to save or invest.

Once the debt is under control, this person can start to build up their savings. It is a good idea to have an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses or job loss. Once that is established, this person can start to focus on longer-term financial goals, such as retirement savings.

Investing can be a great way to grow your wealth over time, but it is important to do your research and understand the risks before investing any money. There are many different investment products available, so it is important to find one that fits your goals and risk tolerance. A financial advisor can help you with this.

Overall, it is important to develop a financial plan and stick to it. Review your budget and goals regularly to make sure you are on track. Making small changes in your spending and saving habits can have a big impact on your financial future.
