imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 20000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 6000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = car

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming this person is living paycheck to paycheck, my advice would be to start by creating a budget. Begin by factoring in all monthly income and expenses, including rent, food, transportation, utilities, and debt payments. Once all monthly expenses are accounted for, this person should have a better idea of how much money they have left over each month. From there, I would advise setting aside money each month to save up for financial goals, like buying a car. This person should also consider investing in a retirement account, like a 401k or IRA, to begin building long-term wealth.
