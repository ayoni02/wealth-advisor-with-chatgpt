imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 10000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 6000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = debts

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Some good financial advice for this person would be to focus on paying down their debts as quickly as possible. One way to do this could be to set up a debt snowball, where the person focuses on paying off their smallest debt first and then moving on to the next largest debt. Another option could be to consolidate their debts into one loan with a lower interest rate. The person should also focus on building up their savings, even if it is just a small amount each month, so that they have some cushion in case of unexpected expenses. Finally, it is always a good idea to create and stick to a budget so that you can better track your spending and make sure you are staying on track financially.
