==========

First and foremost, it’s important to live within your means and make sure your monthly expenses don’t exceed your income. You may need to adjust your budget to make this happen.

Next, you should focus on building up your savings. If you don’t have any savings, you won’t be able to afford any big financial goals, like buying a car. Try to save at least 10% of your income each month.

Finally, you should invest your money. Even if you don’t earn any returns from your investments, you’ll still be better off than if you kept your money in savings account, which typically earn very low interest rates.
