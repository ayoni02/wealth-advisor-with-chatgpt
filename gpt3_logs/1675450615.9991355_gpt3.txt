==========

There are a few things that this person can do in order to improve their financial situation. One is to invest in a 401k or another retirement account so that they will have money saved up for when they retire. Another is to start saving money each month into a savings account so that they have a cushion of cash to fall back on in case of an emergency. Finally, this person should make a budget and stick to it so that they are aware of their spending and can make changes accordingly.
