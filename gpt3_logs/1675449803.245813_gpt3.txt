==========

Assuming you would like specific advice for this person: 

The first thing this person should do is to invest in himself by increasing his skill set and knowledge. He can do this by taking courses, reading books, or attending seminars. Once he has increased his financial literacy, he should then focus on creating a budget and sticking to it. He should make sure to track all of his income and expenses so that he knows where his money is going. He should also start working on building up his savings so that he has a financial cushion to fall back on in case of an emergency. Finally, he should focus on paying off his debts. He can do this by making a budget and allocating a certain amount of money each month to pay down his debts.
