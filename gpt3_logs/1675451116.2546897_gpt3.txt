==========

1. The most important thing for this person to do is to create an emergency fund. This will help them cover unexpected expenses in the future and avoid going into debt. Ideally, this fund should be equal to three to six months of one's living expenses.

2. Another financial goal for this person should be to start investing. Even though returns may be low at first, it is important to start building up a portfolio for the future. Over time, these investments will grow and provide additional income.

3. Finally, this person should try to reduce their monthly expenses. One way to do this is to create a budget and track their spending. By cutting back on unnecessary expenses, they can save more money each month.
