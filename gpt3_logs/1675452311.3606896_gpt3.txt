First, our friend should take a close look at her expenses and see where she can cut back. She should also try to bring in additional income, whether through a side hustle or a salary negotiation at her current job. Once she has a handle on her expenses, she can start chipping away at her debt with a debt snowball or debt avalanche plan. Our friend should also make sure to build up an emergency fund so that unexpected expenses don't derail her debt repayment plan.
