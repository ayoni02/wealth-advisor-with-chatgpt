==========

The first thing you should do is to make a budget and figure out where your money is going. It is important to find ways to reduce your monthly expenses so that you can start saving money. You may want to consider moving to a cheaper apartment or getting rid of some of your unnecessary expenses.

It is also important to start paying off your debts as soon as possible. Paying off your debts will help improve your credit score and make it easier to get approved for loans in the future. You should try to focus on paying off your high-interest debts first. You may want to consider consolidating your debts into one loan with a lower interest rate.

Finally, you should start saving for your future financial goals. Even if you can only save a little bit each month, it is important to start saving now. You may want to consider opening a savings account or investing in a retirement account.
