imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 20000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 0
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = vacation

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming this person is in their 20s-30s, a good comprehensive financial plan would be as follows: 

-Start by saving 10% of your salary into a savings account or a Roth IRA. This will be your "emergency fund" to cover unexpected costs or help you out if you lose your job. 
-Next, work on paying off any debt that you have. This could include student loans, credit card debt, or any other loans. Try to focus on the debt with the highest interest rate first. 
-Once you have a solid savings fund and are debt-free, you can start investing your money. Investing will help you reach your financial goals quicker. 
-Be sure to monitor your progress and adjust your plan as needed. As you get older and your financial situation changes, your plan should change with you.
