imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 10000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 3000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = other

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Some things to consider would be to reduce monthly expenses, increase savings, and invest in a diversified mix of assets. Try to save at least 10% of your salary each month, and invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash. Consider talking to a financial advisor to help you set up a plan and reach your financial goals.
