In order to get out of debt, this person will need to create and follow a budget. This budget should include all of their monthly income and expenses, as well as their debts and debt payments. This person will need to prioritize their debts in order of importance and make payments accordingly.

Some debts, such as credit card debts, may accrue interest. In this case, it is advisable to pay off the debt with the highest interest rate first. This person may also want to consider consolidating their debts into one loan with a lower interest rate in order to save money on interest payments.

This person should also make sure to save up some money in an emergency fund in case they face unexpected expenses. A good rule of thumb is to save up enough money to cover 3-6 months of living expenses. This will help ensure that this person can stay on track with their debt repayment plan even if they experience a financial setback.
