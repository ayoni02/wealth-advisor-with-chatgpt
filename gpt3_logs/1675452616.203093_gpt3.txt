imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 30000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 4000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = business

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

Assuming this person wants to start a business, some financial advice would be to first save up some money to use as seed money for the business. This may mean living frugally for a period of time and foregoing some luxuries. Once the individual has saved up a few thousand dollars, they can start researching and planning their business. Additionally, it may be a good idea to talk to a financial advisor to get a better idea of how to grow their business and make it successful.
