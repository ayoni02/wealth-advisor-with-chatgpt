imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = female
salary = 10000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 1000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = debts

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

If you are a female with a salary of $10,000 and no returns from investments, you should focus on paying off your debts. Try to cut down on your monthly expenses by $500 and put that money towards your debts. You may also want to consider getting a part-time job to help pay off your debts faster. Once your debts are paid off, you can start saving for your other financial goals.
