If you are a male with a salary of 10000 and no returns from investment, your rent is 6000 and your monthly expenses are 500, you have no savings and your financial goals include starting a business, here are some financial tips to consider:

-Start by evaluating your current financial situation and setting a budget. Determine what your monthly income is and track where your money is going. This will help you get a better understanding of your spending patterns and give you a starting point for making changes.

-Create a savings plan. Begin with small goals, such as setting aside $50 from each paycheck, and gradually increase the amount you save as you become more comfortable. An emergency fund is a good idea, as it can help you cover unexpected expenses without going into debt.

-Consider investing in yourself. Investing in your education or career can pay off in the long run, as it can lead to higher earnings potential.

-Pay off high-interest debt. If you have any debt with interest rates above 5%, it may be worth your while to focus on paying this off as quickly as possible. This will save you money in the long run and free up more of your monthly income to save or invest.

-Set financial goals. Having specific goals to work towards can help you stay motivated and on track. Make sure your goals are realistic and achievable, and create a plan for how you will reach them.

-Talk to a financial advisor. A professional can help you assess your current situation, set goals, and give you customised advice on how to best reach your financial goals.
