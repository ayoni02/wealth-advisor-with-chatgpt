imagine a person with the following financial situation;

sex = male
salary = 20000
returns from investment = 0
rent/month = 7000
monthly expenses = 500
savings = 0
financial goals = education

give good comprehensive financial advice to such a person

==========

There are a few things that this person could do in order to get their financial situation under control. The first thing that they should do is to try and save up some money each month. Even if it is just a few hundred dollars, it can really add up over time. Another thing that they could do is to invest some of their money in a good investment opportunity. This could help them to make some money that they can then use to help pay for their education. Finally, they should try to reduce their monthly expenses as much as possible. This will free up more money that they can then use to save up or to invest.
